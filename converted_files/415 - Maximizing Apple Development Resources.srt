[ Applause ]

2
00:00:16.576 --> 00:00:17.476 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello, everyone.

3
00:00:17.846 --> 00:00:19.866 A:middle
And welcome to session 415,

4
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.826 A:middle
Maximizing Apple
Development Resources.

5
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.946 A:middle
My name is Nahir Khan and
I'm an iOS Software Engineer

6
00:00:24.946 --> 00:00:25.716 A:middle
on Springboard.

7
00:00:26.626 --> 00:00:31.056 A:middle
So today, we're going to go
over all the different types,

8
00:00:31.186 --> 00:00:33.226 A:middle
development resources
the Apple provides to.

9
00:00:33.226 --> 00:00:35.486 A:middle
And we're going to
break them up into

10
00:00:35.486 --> 00:00:37.436 A:middle
about three main categories.

11
00:00:38.016 --> 00:00:40.736 A:middle
First one, is Self Help and
this is where we are going

12
00:00:40.736 --> 00:00:43.896 A:middle
to cover Documentation
and Dev Forums.

13
00:00:44.706 --> 00:00:45.996 A:middle
The second, once you've gone

14
00:00:45.996 --> 00:00:48.396 A:middle
through those is
working with Apple.

15
00:00:48.816 --> 00:00:50.796 A:middle
And with that we're
going into Bug Reporting

16
00:00:51.256 --> 00:00:53.996 A:middle
and Developer Technical
Support or DTS for short.

17
00:00:55.356 --> 00:00:57.526 A:middle
Finally, once you've got
your app all ready to go,

18
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:59.836 A:middle
we're talking about getting
your app in the App Store

19
00:01:00.336 --> 00:01:01.706 A:middle
and over here we're
going to talk

20
00:01:01.706 --> 00:01:05.236 A:middle
about App Store and
iTunes Connect.

21
00:01:06.376 --> 00:01:07.586 A:middle
So that, let's start.

22
00:01:08.716 --> 00:01:11.196 A:middle
So the first main
category is Self Help.

23
00:01:11.256 --> 00:01:12.926 A:middle
So the really nice thing

24
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:16.176 A:middle
about these resources is they
can access them 24 hours a day,

25
00:01:16.556 --> 00:01:17.856 A:middle
seven days a week.

26
00:01:17.856 --> 00:01:22.366 A:middle
And they're going to get let
you work at your own pace

27
00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:25.126 A:middle
and get all the information
that you need without having

28
00:01:25.126 --> 00:01:27.826 A:middle
to come here or somewhere
else, it's really nice.

29
00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:31.166 A:middle
So first one we're going to
go over is documentation.

30
00:01:31.776 --> 00:01:35.106 A:middle
So I'm sure you guys
are very familiar

31
00:01:35.106 --> 00:01:37.956 A:middle
with this site,
developer.apple.com.

32
00:01:38.606 --> 00:01:41.156 A:middle
So this is the first place that
you should go when you start off

33
00:01:41.216 --> 00:01:43.466 A:middle
and you learn a new
API, the item we came

34
00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:47.026 A:middle
up with say this week or
is it the new API to you

35
00:01:47.026 --> 00:01:48.066 A:middle
that we've had for some time.

36
00:01:49.346 --> 00:01:51.676 A:middle
First thing you should almost
always do and check out our WWDC

37
00:01:51.676 --> 00:01:55.416 A:middle
and Tech Talk videos 'cause they
give you a nice broad overview

38
00:01:55.416 --> 00:01:58.936 A:middle
of our APIs and designs
and brand new features.

39
00:01:59.746 --> 00:02:02.416 A:middle
Once you've done that,
the next best thing

40
00:02:02.416 --> 00:02:04.466 A:middle
that you can do is go into--

41
00:02:05.426 --> 00:02:07.526 A:middle
and take a look at all the
documentation we have here.

42
00:02:08.036 --> 00:02:12.306 A:middle
We got lot of getting started
guidelines, so if you just want

43
00:02:12.306 --> 00:02:15.366 A:middle
to get in, try to figure out a
broad overview what's going on,

44
00:02:15.366 --> 00:02:16.496 A:middle
this is exactly where
you can go.

45
00:02:16.496 --> 00:02:19.526 A:middle
We also have our entire
development library here,

46
00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:21.986 A:middle
so if you want to
figure out how some API

47
00:02:22.296 --> 00:02:27.486 A:middle
or certain classes work, this
is also where you should go.

48
00:02:27.736 --> 00:02:30.486 A:middle
Lastly, you can also download
all of the sample code

49
00:02:30.486 --> 00:02:34.616 A:middle
and projects that we
provide for any or many

50
00:02:34.616 --> 00:02:36.996 A:middle
of the APIs that we have.

51
00:02:36.996 --> 00:02:39.166 A:middle
There are many new APIs
that came out this week,

52
00:02:39.166 --> 00:02:41.106 A:middle
and if you want to
understand how they work,

53
00:02:41.106 --> 00:02:42.646 A:middle
it's a great place to
download and check it

54
00:02:42.646 --> 00:02:43.506 A:middle
out and run it yourself.

55
00:02:44.186 --> 00:02:47.416 A:middle
So let's get in the
class reference.

56
00:02:48.046 --> 00:02:50.256 A:middle
So, I'm sure many of you
are familiar with this,

57
00:02:50.846 --> 00:02:52.316 A:middle
this is where you can
get the entire reference

58
00:02:52.316 --> 00:02:54.746 A:middle
for your entire API,
you can get--

59
00:02:55.066 --> 00:02:57.626 A:middle
take a look to see what
are the arguments I need

60
00:02:57.626 --> 00:02:59.936 A:middle
in your method names,
all that good stuff,

61
00:02:59.936 --> 00:03:01.776 A:middle
you can also see example code,

62
00:03:01.776 --> 00:03:03.766 A:middle
so you can see exactly
what you need to do

63
00:03:03.766 --> 00:03:07.036 A:middle
to actually use these
great new features in APIs.

64
00:03:08.186 --> 00:03:10.986 A:middle
And lastly, you can also
checkout some common issues

65
00:03:11.036 --> 00:03:12.536 A:middle
and frequently asked
questions that we have

66
00:03:13.086 --> 00:03:15.066 A:middle
or that you may have
about the APIs.

67
00:03:15.066 --> 00:03:17.336 A:middle
There's usually, if
you have a question,

68
00:03:17.336 --> 00:03:18.886 A:middle
and you not really
understand what's going on,

69
00:03:19.236 --> 00:03:22.166 A:middle
there's usually a very
good chance that's covered

70
00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:25.526 A:middle
in the common issues and
frequently asked questions.

71
00:03:26.906 --> 00:03:29.666 A:middle
One thing I should want to call
out our full programming guides.

72
00:03:30.136 --> 00:03:32.756 A:middle
These are entire books
worth of content here,

73
00:03:33.176 --> 00:03:36.176 A:middle
whether it starting off with
Objective-C and you want

74
00:03:36.176 --> 00:03:38.876 A:middle
to know how that works, you got
there, or say you want again

75
00:03:38.876 --> 00:03:42.026 A:middle
in to OpenGL, we actually have
the entire documentation on that

76
00:03:42.026 --> 00:03:46.316 A:middle
as well, or in this case we
have brand new text editing APIs

77
00:03:46.316 --> 00:03:50.406 A:middle
and iOS for iOS 7,
really great stuff here.

78
00:03:51.066 --> 00:03:55.466 A:middle
But I know what you're thinking,
you don't want to go onto--

79
00:03:55.466 --> 00:03:58.476 A:middle
have a Safari window open
and have that next to you.

80
00:03:58.476 --> 00:04:00.856 A:middle
If you're anything like me,
when you're coding away,

81
00:04:00.856 --> 00:04:03.896 A:middle
you want to be able to access
stuff nice and quickly.

82
00:04:04.006 --> 00:04:06.686 A:middle
And the cool thing is, you
can access all the stuff right

83
00:04:06.686 --> 00:04:08.776 A:middle
from Xcode and the Help menu.

84
00:04:09.406 --> 00:04:11.386 A:middle
Go there and you get
the documentation API

85
00:04:11.386 --> 00:04:12.096 A:middle
Reference guide.

86
00:04:12.166 --> 00:04:16.026 A:middle
And the nice thing is in Xcode
5, we've actually revamp this

87
00:04:16.026 --> 00:04:19.426 A:middle
to make it really, really
nice and easy to go through

88
00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:20.375 A:middle
and check these things out.

89
00:04:20.375 --> 00:04:24.796 A:middle
And not only that, there are
a lot of other cool things

90
00:04:24.796 --> 00:04:25.996 A:middle
that you can do in
Xcode as well.

91
00:04:25.996 --> 00:04:31.226 A:middle
For example, the
Option-click on any symbol,

92
00:04:31.636 --> 00:04:34.426 A:middle
you can get a nice quick
description of what's going on

93
00:04:34.786 --> 00:04:36.796 A:middle
and also access the header
files if you want to go in

94
00:04:36.796 --> 00:04:38.106 A:middle
and get maybe a bit
more information.

95
00:04:38.866 --> 00:04:42.146 A:middle
The nice thing is you can also
get a one click access directly

96
00:04:42.146 --> 00:04:43.156 A:middle
to the Reference guide there.

97
00:04:43.156 --> 00:04:44.806 A:middle
So you don't actually
have to like go and search

98
00:04:44.806 --> 00:04:49.306 A:middle
for that online, you got
it right through Xcode.

99
00:04:49.426 --> 00:04:51.966 A:middle
We also have a bit more
information in the sidebar

100
00:04:52.026 --> 00:04:53.096 A:middle
when you click on the symbol.

101
00:04:53.366 --> 00:04:57.066 A:middle
You get the same access to the
headers and the API reference,

102
00:04:57.426 --> 00:05:00.876 A:middle
but you also get our links
to any programming guides

103
00:05:01.476 --> 00:05:04.416 A:middle
that might be helpful with
that particular symbol

104
00:05:04.416 --> 00:05:05.806 A:middle
that you'll looking at.

105
00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:08.586 A:middle
Another nice thing is that
you can get one-click access

106
00:05:08.806 --> 00:05:11.466 A:middle
to some sample code as well,
it's really, really nice.

107
00:05:12.076 --> 00:05:16.386 A:middle
One thing I want to call
out though is at the bottom

108
00:05:16.386 --> 00:05:21.256 A:middle
of all our documentation
pages is a feedback area.

109
00:05:21.596 --> 00:05:23.856 A:middle
So over here this is where you
can go and report any typos,

110
00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:25.636 A:middle
missing information
that you see,

111
00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:28.116 A:middle
maybe if something
it's confusing or even

112
00:05:28.116 --> 00:05:30.066 A:middle
if something was helpful,
this is really great

113
00:05:30.066 --> 00:05:32.796 A:middle
where you can tell us how we can
make things better even for you.

114
00:05:33.306 --> 00:05:35.066 A:middle
So, if you go in
and you find, wow,

115
00:05:35.066 --> 00:05:37.826 A:middle
this are really nice document
I was reading and I'd really

116
00:05:37.826 --> 00:05:40.116 A:middle
like it some more stuff
is like that, let us know.

117
00:05:41.096 --> 00:05:44.076 A:middle
If you think, that was like
90 percent that way there,

118
00:05:44.076 --> 00:05:46.266 A:middle
but there is something else
that could make this even great,

119
00:05:46.266 --> 00:05:49.666 A:middle
let us know that or something
wasn't helpful at all,

120
00:05:50.146 --> 00:05:50.806 A:middle
that's where you can go.

121
00:05:51.106 --> 00:05:55.416 A:middle
So once you've actually
gone through documentation

122
00:05:55.416 --> 00:05:57.976 A:middle
that you're working on,
still not sure what to do,

123
00:05:58.116 --> 00:06:01.176 A:middle
the next best place you can
go is the Developer Forums.

124
00:06:01.816 --> 00:06:08.056 A:middle
So devforums.apple.com and
we have areas for iOS, OS X.

125
00:06:08.056 --> 00:06:13.306 A:middle
And we also have areas for
our tools and also deployment

126
00:06:13.306 --> 00:06:16.786 A:middle
and other types of things
that we provide as well.

127
00:06:17.406 --> 00:06:21.786 A:middle
So the nice thing about
the developer forums is

128
00:06:21.786 --> 00:06:22.706 A:middle
that you have peer support.

129
00:06:22.706 --> 00:06:24.806 A:middle
So you're actually there
working with the rest

130
00:06:24.806 --> 00:06:26.276 A:middle
of the Apple developer
community.

131
00:06:27.226 --> 00:06:29.896 A:middle
So when you have an issue and
you're not sure what's going on,

132
00:06:30.686 --> 00:06:32.546 A:middle
the nice thing about the dev
forums, it's a really nice place

133
00:06:32.546 --> 00:06:34.986 A:middle
where you can go
and get some help

134
00:06:34.986 --> 00:06:36.316 A:middle
and maybe triage your problem.

135
00:06:36.596 --> 00:06:38.226 A:middle
So, see and try to
actually drill

136
00:06:38.226 --> 00:06:42.016 A:middle
down to see what exactly is
going on, is it may be an issue

137
00:06:42.016 --> 00:06:44.706 A:middle
in a certain API was working, is
it maybe issue in your own code,

138
00:06:44.706 --> 00:06:46.076 A:middle
maybe it's an issue
with some virus stuffs,

139
00:06:46.726 --> 00:06:47.806 A:middle
it's where you can do that.

140
00:06:48.386 --> 00:06:49.996 A:middle
The nice thing is,
you can also search

141
00:06:50.686 --> 00:06:54.986 A:middle
if someone else has a question,
maybe it'll be helpful to you

142
00:06:55.256 --> 00:06:56.866 A:middle
or if they get that answered.

143
00:06:57.796 --> 00:07:02.106 A:middle
And also, you also have Apple
employees there as well.

144
00:07:02.996 --> 00:07:07.666 A:middle
So over here, if you see an
Apple avatar right there Dr.

145
00:07:07.666 --> 00:07:10.126 A:middle
Ernie, he's actually
one of our moderators

146
00:07:10.126 --> 00:07:12.366 A:middle
that you can see always
around helping people out.

147
00:07:12.366 --> 00:07:15.516 A:middle
And there are also
engineers on here as well.

148
00:07:15.926 --> 00:07:17.066 A:middle
So if you have a question,

149
00:07:17.436 --> 00:07:19.566 A:middle
engineers are visiting
these as well.

150
00:07:19.566 --> 00:07:23.286 A:middle
One thing I want to
call out though is

151
00:07:23.286 --> 00:07:25.606 A:middle
that the forums are
kind of public,

152
00:07:26.096 --> 00:07:28.336 A:middle
so if you have a question that
might be a bit confidential

153
00:07:28.336 --> 00:07:29.406 A:middle
for your own application,

154
00:07:30.256 --> 00:07:31.786 A:middle
everyone can see
what you post here.

155
00:07:32.416 --> 00:07:34.216 A:middle
So if you don't want
to go through that

156
00:07:34.216 --> 00:07:37.166 A:middle
and don't want everyone to
see what your secret stuff is,

157
00:07:37.276 --> 00:07:41.866 A:middle
I suggest you check out DTS,
and we'll go into that in a bit.

158
00:07:43.656 --> 00:07:46.216 A:middle
So let's go over an example
post, don't need to go

159
00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:48.176 A:middle
into too much, just some
things I want to call out here.

160
00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:49.926 A:middle
So over here we have
someone who's has--

161
00:07:50.306 --> 00:07:54.036 A:middle
is reading some of our example
code and the guy got confused

162
00:07:54.036 --> 00:07:55.036 A:middle
on something, what's
going on here,

163
00:07:55.036 --> 00:07:56.656 A:middle
it doesn't really
following some guideline.

164
00:07:57.906 --> 00:08:04.346 A:middle
And actually, Rincewind is
actually an Apple engineer.

165
00:08:04.376 --> 00:08:06.006 A:middle
So if you ever see an avatar

166
00:08:06.006 --> 00:08:07.506 A:middle
with the little Apple
logo right next to it,

167
00:08:08.246 --> 00:08:09.856 A:middle
know that's an engineer
helping you out here.

168
00:08:10.226 --> 00:08:11.766 A:middle
Also we have little area there

169
00:08:11.766 --> 00:08:13.736 A:middle
where you can say a post
was actually helpful

170
00:08:13.736 --> 00:08:14.756 A:middle
or not very helpful to you.

171
00:08:15.376 --> 00:08:17.896 A:middle
And the nice thing is other
developers can see this as well.

172
00:08:17.896 --> 00:08:23.706 A:middle
So someone answers your question
and it really helped you out,

173
00:08:23.976 --> 00:08:26.096 A:middle
let other developers
know so that they'll know

174
00:08:26.096 --> 00:08:27.396 A:middle
that this is exactly
what they need to--

175
00:08:28.106 --> 00:08:29.926 A:middle
that's an exactly
answer that they want.

176
00:08:31.066 --> 00:08:32.226 A:middle
You'd also report a post.

177
00:08:32.226 --> 00:08:34.635 A:middle
So that doesn't necessarily
mean that something is bad here,

178
00:08:34.716 --> 00:08:36.206 A:middle
it could be as really
great question

179
00:08:36.206 --> 00:08:37.326 A:middle
but maybe it's in
the wrong area.

180
00:08:37.996 --> 00:08:40.765 A:middle
So if you click there, a
moderator can go take a look

181
00:08:40.765 --> 00:08:42.366 A:middle
on what's going on,
actually moving around.

182
00:08:45.096 --> 00:08:47.386 A:middle
Next, once you've gone
through all these things,

183
00:08:47.456 --> 00:08:50.876 A:middle
let's go in the areas
about helping with Apple.

184
00:08:51.006 --> 00:08:52.756 A:middle
So you work with
some documentation,

185
00:08:52.756 --> 00:08:57.016 A:middle
you got your app ready to go
and you need some help from us.

186
00:08:57.216 --> 00:09:00.676 A:middle
So, one of the first main areas
about this is bug reporting

187
00:09:00.676 --> 00:09:04.676 A:middle
and for that I'm going
to hand off to Tanya.

188
00:09:05.516 --> 00:09:09.556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

189
00:09:10.056 --> 00:09:10.796 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Nahir.

190
00:09:11.166 --> 00:09:11.826 A:middle
Good morning, everyone.

191
00:09:11.826 --> 00:09:14.196 A:middle
Thanks for joining us
here, I know it's Friday

192
00:09:14.196 --> 00:09:15.856 A:middle
and it's almost lunch.

193
00:09:15.976 --> 00:09:18.496 A:middle
So I'll try to make it
as quick as possible.

194
00:09:18.976 --> 00:09:22.526 A:middle
My Name is Tanya and I'm
an iOS Software Engineer

195
00:09:22.556 --> 00:09:23.436 A:middle
on the MAPS team.

196
00:09:23.436 --> 00:09:26.066 A:middle
And today, we're going
to talk about a topic

197
00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:27.926 A:middle
that is very near
and dear to me.

198
00:09:27.926 --> 00:09:29.666 A:middle
In fact, it's near
and dear to a lot

199
00:09:29.666 --> 00:09:31.546 A:middle
of Apple engineers,
bug reporting.

200
00:09:31.616 --> 00:09:35.256 A:middle
And we're going to talk about
how you can utilize bug reports

201
00:09:35.256 --> 00:09:38.306 A:middle
to communicate with Apple
regarding the issues you've been

202
00:09:38.306 --> 00:09:38.916 A:middle
running into.

203
00:09:39.196 --> 00:09:43.646 A:middle
So let's start with the
very fundamental question

204
00:09:44.146 --> 00:09:45.856 A:middle
on why should you
file bug reports?

205
00:09:45.926 --> 00:09:52.216 A:middle
You should file bug reports
because it provides a way for us

206
00:09:52.216 --> 00:09:55.106 A:middle
as Apple engineers to
help you out directly.

207
00:09:55.106 --> 00:10:00.316 A:middle
You see we worked really hard
to make an amazing platform,

208
00:10:00.316 --> 00:10:04.146 A:middle
make amazing tools that help
you make wonderful applications

209
00:10:04.146 --> 00:10:05.456 A:middle
that delight our customers.

210
00:10:06.086 --> 00:10:09.636 A:middle
But sometimes, there might be
issues, there might be problems

211
00:10:09.726 --> 00:10:12.996 A:middle
that we did not anticipate,
and when you run into these,

212
00:10:12.996 --> 00:10:14.396 A:middle
we would like you
to let us know.

213
00:10:14.396 --> 00:10:16.256 A:middle
We would like you to let us know

214
00:10:16.256 --> 00:10:18.826 A:middle
so that we can take
the appropriate action

215
00:10:19.006 --> 00:10:20.246 A:middle
to address those quickly.

216
00:10:20.806 --> 00:10:24.396 A:middle
When you file a bug
report it goes directly

217
00:10:24.396 --> 00:10:27.576 A:middle
to an Apple engineer, I
read these bug reports.

218
00:10:27.976 --> 00:10:30.606 A:middle
All the engineers, you might
have met during the labs

219
00:10:30.606 --> 00:10:32.896 A:middle
and sessions, they
read your bug reports,

220
00:10:32.896 --> 00:10:35.316 A:middle
they're surely not eaten by
the trolls in our dungeons,

221
00:10:35.576 --> 00:10:37.186 A:middle
this feedback is important,

222
00:10:37.346 --> 00:10:38.796 A:middle
these back reports
are important.

223
00:10:39.356 --> 00:10:42.946 A:middle
So, if you want a direct
communication channel

224
00:10:43.156 --> 00:10:46.026 A:middle
to an Apple engineer to
tell us some of the--

225
00:10:46.026 --> 00:10:49.116 A:middle
to tell about the issues
that he would be encountering

226
00:10:49.446 --> 00:10:52.796 A:middle
in our software, bug
reports are the way to go.

227
00:10:53.636 --> 00:10:56.846 A:middle
Sometimes, when I tell
people to file bugs,

228
00:10:57.146 --> 00:10:58.256 A:middle
they have a few questions.

229
00:10:59.086 --> 00:11:02.976 A:middle
Sometimes they say, well,
Tanya, I saw this problem,

230
00:11:02.976 --> 00:11:05.746 A:middle
but it was an extremely
trivial issue,

231
00:11:05.746 --> 00:11:09.846 A:middle
you see perhaps it was a typo
or the color was a little off,

232
00:11:10.266 --> 00:11:11.596 A:middle
should I still file
a bug report?

233
00:11:11.896 --> 00:11:13.416 A:middle
Yes, absolutely.

234
00:11:13.736 --> 00:11:14.776 A:middle
File a bug report.

235
00:11:15.516 --> 00:11:18.086 A:middle
You see, a problem
that might seem trivial

236
00:11:18.086 --> 00:11:20.856 A:middle
to you might have some
really bad consequences.

237
00:11:21.546 --> 00:11:25.456 A:middle
Also it might manifest
itself in worse ways.

238
00:11:25.926 --> 00:11:26.946 A:middle
So file a bug report.

239
00:11:28.256 --> 00:11:32.696 A:middle
Sometimes we say, well, you
know, this problem happened once

240
00:11:32.966 --> 00:11:36.166 A:middle
and it never happened again,
I never ever saw this again.

241
00:11:36.536 --> 00:11:37.836 A:middle
Should I still file
a bug report?

242
00:11:38.496 --> 00:11:40.576 A:middle
Yes, you should file
a bug report.

243
00:11:41.506 --> 00:11:44.746 A:middle
You see, even though, the
problem only happened once,

244
00:11:45.776 --> 00:11:48.326 A:middle
it might still have been a
really bad user experience.

245
00:11:48.756 --> 00:11:52.336 A:middle
Others might hit it too and
other might hit it more number

246
00:11:52.336 --> 00:11:54.746 A:middle
of times, so file a bug report.

247
00:11:55.296 --> 00:11:59.196 A:middle
Sometimes they say, well,
it's a really obvious problem,

248
00:11:59.196 --> 00:12:01.936 A:middle
I'm sure you have 12
copies of the bug.

249
00:12:02.456 --> 00:12:04.796 A:middle
I am sure someone else
has already filed it,

250
00:12:05.376 --> 00:12:06.776 A:middle
should I still file
a bug report?

251
00:12:07.196 --> 00:12:10.036 A:middle
Yes. You should still
file a bug report.

252
00:12:10.836 --> 00:12:15.166 A:middle
You see, it's better to
have five copies of the bug

253
00:12:15.706 --> 00:12:16.756 A:middle
than to have none at all,

254
00:12:17.286 --> 00:12:18.696 A:middle
there's a good reason
I say that.

255
00:12:19.236 --> 00:12:25.296 A:middle
At Apple, if an issue is not
tracked using a bug report,

256
00:12:25.916 --> 00:12:28.686 A:middle
it essentially does
not exist for us.

257
00:12:30.256 --> 00:12:32.906 A:middle
Bug reports are like
to-do items,

258
00:12:33.836 --> 00:12:37.516 A:middle
we track everything using bug
reports, bugs [inaudible],

259
00:12:37.866 --> 00:12:42.836 A:middle
even big features that go
into a particular release.

260
00:12:43.986 --> 00:12:46.146 A:middle
And some other things
that might not seem

261
00:12:46.146 --> 00:12:48.096 A:middle
so obvious to start off of it.

262
00:12:48.626 --> 00:12:54.706 A:middle
When I come into work
every morning, in fact,

263
00:12:54.706 --> 00:12:58.206 A:middle
when all Apple engineers
come into work every morning,

264
00:12:59.016 --> 00:13:02.546 A:middle
the first thing we do is to
go through our list of bugs

265
00:13:02.686 --> 00:13:06.976 A:middle
to figure out what is it
that we need to do that day.

266
00:13:07.156 --> 00:13:10.476 A:middle
To figure out, if you're on
track for a particular release,

267
00:13:10.876 --> 00:13:16.016 A:middle
I know that's a good
one, it's an actual bug.

268
00:13:16.146 --> 00:13:18.716 A:middle
To figure out, if
you're on track

269
00:13:18.716 --> 00:13:22.176 A:middle
for a particular release our
program office, our management,

270
00:13:22.176 --> 00:13:25.366 A:middle
they go through a list of bugs
to figure out if you're focusing

271
00:13:25.366 --> 00:13:27.096 A:middle
on the right things
at the right time.

272
00:13:27.696 --> 00:13:30.256 A:middle
So we track everything using
these bug reports, bugs,

273
00:13:30.986 --> 00:13:33.316 A:middle
features, coffee
problems, elevator problems,

274
00:13:33.446 --> 00:13:35.866 A:middle
all of that, these
are important.

275
00:13:37.196 --> 00:13:41.176 A:middle
So now that we know why these
bug reports are important,

276
00:13:41.336 --> 00:13:43.966 A:middle
where do you actually
go to file these?

277
00:13:45.276 --> 00:13:50.396 A:middle
The one stop shop for filing bug
reports is bugreport.apple.com,

278
00:13:50.396 --> 00:13:53.206 A:middle
this is the only official
way of filing bug reports.

279
00:13:53.326 --> 00:13:56.326 A:middle
When you file a bug report, you
are provided with a problem ID

280
00:13:56.326 --> 00:14:01.146 A:middle
and you can use this ID to
track the status of your bug.

281
00:14:02.076 --> 00:14:05.236 A:middle
Also, even after the bug
is filed, you have a way

282
00:14:05.236 --> 00:14:06.796 A:middle
to provide additional
information.

283
00:14:07.236 --> 00:14:08.286 A:middle
On the other hand,

284
00:14:08.416 --> 00:14:11.986 A:middle
if the engineers have any
clarifying questions for you,

285
00:14:12.496 --> 00:14:14.926 A:middle
they have a means to get back
to you with these questions.

286
00:14:14.926 --> 00:14:18.806 A:middle
And one thing to keep
in mind when you're file

287
00:14:18.806 --> 00:14:21.916 A:middle
in this bug reports is
to keep things specific.

288
00:14:22.766 --> 00:14:25.576 A:middle
Follow the golden
rule of bug filing,

289
00:14:26.236 --> 00:14:29.286 A:middle
just to use one report
for one issue.

290
00:14:30.076 --> 00:14:33.516 A:middle
Things that might seem
related to you, and might seem

291
00:14:33.516 --> 00:14:35.696 A:middle
like they can be
grouped together

292
00:14:36.136 --> 00:14:39.816 A:middle
into one bug report might
actually very different things

293
00:14:39.816 --> 00:14:43.086 A:middle
and there might be different
engineers working on it.

294
00:14:43.786 --> 00:14:48.376 A:middle
So help us track things better
by keeping things specific,

295
00:14:49.026 --> 00:14:51.246 A:middle
so file one report
for one issue.

296
00:14:52.716 --> 00:14:55.576 A:middle
So what do you file
these bug reports for?

297
00:14:55.576 --> 00:14:57.316 A:middle
Well, when it comes to software,

298
00:14:57.646 --> 00:15:01.636 A:middle
there are few things you can
use these bug reports for.

299
00:15:02.276 --> 00:15:06.776 A:middle
Bugs, if you notice something
does not work as expected,

300
00:15:07.346 --> 00:15:10.106 A:middle
that's a software defect, that's
a bug, so file a bug report.

301
00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:14.986 A:middle
If you notice an application
quits unexpectedly or crashes

302
00:15:15.666 --> 00:15:20.226 A:middle
or if it's hanging and
unresponsive, file a bug report.

303
00:15:21.346 --> 00:15:25.556 A:middle
If you notice your
application slow or hanging

304
00:15:25.556 --> 00:15:28.066 A:middle
or perhaps leaking memory
and you think it's a problem

305
00:15:28.066 --> 00:15:30.086 A:middle
in our API, file a bug report.

306
00:15:30.546 --> 00:15:36.246 A:middle
If you have a suggestion for a
new feature or an improvement

307
00:15:36.246 --> 00:15:39.056 A:middle
of an existing feature,
file a bug report.

308
00:15:39.486 --> 00:15:42.616 A:middle
One thing to keep in mind

309
00:15:42.766 --> 00:15:44.836 A:middle
when you're filing
these bug reports is

310
00:15:44.896 --> 00:15:47.076 A:middle
to file them as early
as possible.

311
00:15:47.846 --> 00:15:50.506 A:middle
Do not wait till the last
seed to report an issue

312
00:15:50.506 --> 00:15:53.066 A:middle
that might be blocking
essential functionality

313
00:15:53.066 --> 00:15:54.026 A:middle
of your application.

314
00:15:54.806 --> 00:15:56.996 A:middle
There's a good reason why
I say that and it relates

315
00:15:56.996 --> 00:15:58.266 A:middle
to how we schedule things.

316
00:15:58.266 --> 00:16:01.556 A:middle
So let's look at the
graphical representation

317
00:16:01.746 --> 00:16:02.926 A:middle
of the problem at hand.

318
00:16:03.636 --> 00:16:07.586 A:middle
So the horizontal axis
represents the various

319
00:16:07.586 --> 00:16:09.256 A:middle
milestones in our release.

320
00:16:09.806 --> 00:16:13.156 A:middle
The vertical axis
represents the probability

321
00:16:13.626 --> 00:16:18.546 A:middle
that the bug will get addressed
in that particular release.

322
00:16:18.546 --> 00:16:20.506 A:middle
If you notice the blue line

323
00:16:20.506 --> 00:16:23.466 A:middle
that relates little
parameters curves downwards.

324
00:16:23.886 --> 00:16:26.026 A:middle
So if the green arrow
had to present

325
00:16:26.436 --> 00:16:31.056 A:middle
when we receive the bug
report, you can tell easily

326
00:16:31.056 --> 00:16:34.196 A:middle
that the sooner you file,
the higher the chances

327
00:16:34.626 --> 00:16:36.986 A:middle
that your bug report,
bug will get addressed

328
00:16:37.346 --> 00:16:38.406 A:middle
in that particular release.

329
00:16:38.846 --> 00:16:41.996 A:middle
On the other hand, if you
wait till the last minute,

330
00:16:42.286 --> 00:16:43.346 A:middle
we run out of time.

331
00:16:43.926 --> 00:16:45.886 A:middle
Also the fix that is needed

332
00:16:46.256 --> 00:16:47.916 A:middle
to resolve the problem
you had reported,

333
00:16:47.916 --> 00:16:52.326 A:middle
it might be very risky, so we
might not be able to incorporate

334
00:16:52.326 --> 00:16:54.076 A:middle
that into a particular release.

335
00:16:54.506 --> 00:16:57.606 A:middle
But does that mean,
it just expires,

336
00:16:57.606 --> 00:16:58.666 A:middle
we don't look at it ever?

337
00:16:58.666 --> 00:16:59.506 A:middle
Absolutely no.

338
00:17:00.486 --> 00:17:03.306 A:middle
We will address that
in the next release.

339
00:17:03.846 --> 00:17:07.156 A:middle
Now there are few
other things you can do

340
00:17:07.566 --> 00:17:11.006 A:middle
to improve the chances of your
bug getting fixed in time.

341
00:17:11.006 --> 00:17:12.226 A:middle
But before we talk about that,

342
00:17:13.205 --> 00:17:17.205 A:middle
let's look at what actually
happens after you file your bug.

343
00:17:17.856 --> 00:17:19.715 A:middle
So as we had established
earlier,

344
00:17:20.656 --> 00:17:23.546 A:middle
it goes directly to
an Apple engineer.

345
00:17:24.506 --> 00:17:27.546 A:middle
The engineer might forward
it to other engineers

346
00:17:27.906 --> 00:17:30.176 A:middle
if the underlying cause
of the issue is not

347
00:17:30.326 --> 00:17:31.596 A:middle
in their area of expertise.

348
00:17:32.526 --> 00:17:35.036 A:middle
But for the sake of
simplicity, let's just assume,

349
00:17:35.336 --> 00:17:36.746 A:middle
it stays with that one engineer.

350
00:17:37.836 --> 00:17:39.236 A:middle
Now in the perfect scenario,

351
00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:43.846 A:middle
the engineer will understand the
problem, will investigate it,

352
00:17:44.076 --> 00:17:46.936 A:middle
come up with the fix, and
integrate that into a build.

353
00:17:47.796 --> 00:17:51.006 A:middle
Once the fix becomes
available in a release build,

354
00:17:51.206 --> 00:17:53.126 A:middle
we send the bug back to you.

355
00:17:54.066 --> 00:17:57.506 A:middle
Now we recommend that when
you get back the bug report,

356
00:17:58.026 --> 00:18:00.956 A:middle
you verify that the problem
was fixed and we also recommend

357
00:18:00.956 --> 00:18:03.296 A:middle
that you do this as
soon as possible.

358
00:18:03.826 --> 00:18:07.556 A:middle
You see sometimes, the issue
might not have actually been

359
00:18:07.666 --> 00:18:11.226 A:middle
fixed and you have the option
of sending the bug back to us

360
00:18:11.866 --> 00:18:13.756 A:middle
and by responding
quickly, you make sure

361
00:18:13.756 --> 00:18:17.626 A:middle
that there still enough time
for us to reinvestigate it

362
00:18:17.626 --> 00:18:20.266 A:middle
and still fix it in
that particular release.

363
00:18:22.276 --> 00:18:25.406 A:middle
Sometimes, the bug
may come back to you

364
00:18:25.406 --> 00:18:27.806 A:middle
as a duplicate, what
does this mean?

365
00:18:28.626 --> 00:18:31.996 A:middle
This means that there is an
existing bug report that we have

366
00:18:32.386 --> 00:18:35.676 A:middle
that is tracking the same
issue as you had reported.

367
00:18:36.176 --> 00:18:38.836 A:middle
Now does this mean this is
just a waste of your time?

368
00:18:38.836 --> 00:18:39.546 A:middle
Absolutely not.

369
00:18:39.926 --> 00:18:41.556 A:middle
Duplicates are important.

370
00:18:42.516 --> 00:18:45.566 A:middle
You see, your bug report
might have better information,

371
00:18:45.566 --> 00:18:47.626 A:middle
it might have more
actionable data

372
00:18:48.236 --> 00:18:50.126 A:middle
than the original
bug that was filed.

373
00:18:51.026 --> 00:18:55.236 A:middle
Also many times, we use a number
of duplicates as an indicator

374
00:18:55.236 --> 00:18:57.736 A:middle
of how widespread the problem is

375
00:18:57.826 --> 00:19:00.366 A:middle
so that we can prioritize
it correctly.

376
00:19:01.536 --> 00:19:06.466 A:middle
Even if your issue was tagged as
a duplicate, you have the option

377
00:19:06.566 --> 00:19:10.116 A:middle
of requesting status of the
original bug, just put a comment

378
00:19:10.116 --> 00:19:13.106 A:middle
in your bug report and we will
provide the relevant information

379
00:19:13.106 --> 00:19:14.046 A:middle
to you.

380
00:19:16.476 --> 00:19:21.756 A:middle
Sometimes, when you file a bug,
we might send it back to you

381
00:19:21.796 --> 00:19:23.456 A:middle
as insufficient information.

382
00:19:24.306 --> 00:19:25.166 A:middle
What does this mean?

383
00:19:26.006 --> 00:19:30.256 A:middle
This means that the bug report
does not have enough information

384
00:19:30.256 --> 00:19:32.006 A:middle
for us to diagnose the problem.

385
00:19:32.986 --> 00:19:35.476 A:middle
Now if possible you
want to avoid running

386
00:19:35.476 --> 00:19:39.246 A:middle
into this scenario, and there
is a good reason why I say that.

387
00:19:39.716 --> 00:19:43.106 A:middle
Let's bring back our older time

388
00:19:43.106 --> 00:19:44.266 A:middle
versus [phonetic]
probability graph

389
00:19:44.466 --> 00:19:45.536 A:middle
and see what it looks like.

390
00:19:46.026 --> 00:19:49.146 A:middle
If you read-- you did the
right thing by filing early,

391
00:19:49.146 --> 00:19:50.716 A:middle
so you started out strong.

392
00:19:51.036 --> 00:19:53.936 A:middle
But unfortunately, the bug
report did not contain enough

393
00:19:53.936 --> 00:19:56.726 A:middle
information, so we
sent it back to you

394
00:19:56.726 --> 00:19:58.036 A:middle
with clarifying questions.

395
00:19:58.786 --> 00:20:00.266 A:middle
You collected the information

396
00:20:00.266 --> 00:20:02.266 A:middle
and sent it back to
us which is great.

397
00:20:03.186 --> 00:20:06.626 A:middle
But unfortunately in all
this valuable time was lost.

398
00:20:07.306 --> 00:20:10.336 A:middle
So even though you had
started out strong,

399
00:20:10.666 --> 00:20:13.956 A:middle
you end up on the lower
part of the curve.

400
00:20:14.146 --> 00:20:16.686 A:middle
To avoid this back and
forth formal information,

401
00:20:17.256 --> 00:20:21.936 A:middle
start out with a well
written actionable bug report

402
00:20:22.026 --> 00:20:24.856 A:middle
in the first place.

403
00:20:24.856 --> 00:20:28.506 A:middle
To make your bug report
actionable it should be clear,

404
00:20:29.296 --> 00:20:33.586 A:middle
concise, informative,
constructive and specific.

405
00:20:34.896 --> 00:20:37.806 A:middle
To ensure that your bug report
has all these qualities,

406
00:20:37.806 --> 00:20:41.796 A:middle
let's go to the different
components of a bug report

407
00:20:41.796 --> 00:20:44.856 A:middle
and talk about some of the
things you should keep in mind

408
00:20:45.486 --> 00:20:46.576 A:middle
when you're filing a bug report.

409
00:20:46.576 --> 00:20:51.606 A:middle
So here are the different
components of a bug report,

410
00:20:52.316 --> 00:20:56.046 A:middle
the problem report title,
the problem detail section,

411
00:20:56.686 --> 00:20:57.866 A:middle
additional enclosures,

412
00:20:58.416 --> 00:21:01.116 A:middle
configuration information
and reproducibility.

413
00:21:01.596 --> 00:21:05.296 A:middle
Let's start by looking
at the title.

414
00:21:05.296 --> 00:21:11.756 A:middle
Think of the title as an
advertisement for your issue.

415
00:21:12.926 --> 00:21:16.176 A:middle
You want it so that when the
engineer reads the title they

416
00:21:16.176 --> 00:21:18.186 A:middle
want to open it and
investigate it.

417
00:21:18.186 --> 00:21:21.036 A:middle
A good title is clear
and succinct.

418
00:21:21.576 --> 00:21:24.796 A:middle
Think of it like a tweet, you
see, you have limited space,

419
00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:29.076 A:middle
but yet you want it to convey
as much information as possible.

420
00:21:29.896 --> 00:21:32.906 A:middle
So make every word
count, avoid filler words.

421
00:21:33.106 --> 00:21:36.606 A:middle
Drop off any articles of
preposition or pronouns

422
00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:37.826 A:middle
that are not needed there.

423
00:21:38.406 --> 00:21:42.016 A:middle
So a good title should
stand on its own.

424
00:21:43.056 --> 00:21:47.656 A:middle
You see a title is often seen
a list of tens or thousands

425
00:21:47.656 --> 00:21:50.446 A:middle
of bugs and could be
totally out of context,

426
00:21:51.316 --> 00:21:56.276 A:middle
also above title is often use
as a search for you issue.

427
00:21:57.136 --> 00:21:59.196 A:middle
So, when you're coming up
with the bug title think

428
00:21:59.196 --> 00:22:02.166 A:middle
about how is it that you
would search for the issue

429
00:22:03.136 --> 00:22:04.936 A:middle
and hopefully that will
give you some hints

430
00:22:05.056 --> 00:22:06.926 A:middle
on how to structure it.

431
00:22:07.896 --> 00:22:10.506 A:middle
So let's look at an example.

432
00:22:10.506 --> 00:22:13.246 A:middle
Here we have one, copy
and paste is broken.

433
00:22:14.396 --> 00:22:17.486 A:middle
Now, it's surely succinct
its only five words.

434
00:22:17.486 --> 00:22:20.416 A:middle
It's probably descriptive
though,

435
00:22:20.416 --> 00:22:23.456 A:middle
it doesn't really tell us how
is it if we perform the copy

436
00:22:23.456 --> 00:22:26.196 A:middle
and paste and surely we don't
know what we mean by broken.

437
00:22:26.196 --> 00:22:27.676 A:middle
So let's improve this further.

438
00:22:27.676 --> 00:22:32.276 A:middle
Here we are at information
about how is it's that we--

439
00:22:32.276 --> 00:22:33.966 A:middle
that perform the copy operation.

440
00:22:34.206 --> 00:22:35.036 A:middle
This is fine.

441
00:22:36.076 --> 00:22:38.496 A:middle
But there's still the
word broken in there,

442
00:22:38.786 --> 00:22:40.726 A:middle
which is not descriptive.

443
00:22:41.516 --> 00:22:44.586 A:middle
So we add information about
what is it that we saw.

444
00:22:44.586 --> 00:22:49.116 A:middle
Now this is pretty good,
but we can get bonus points

445
00:22:49.486 --> 00:22:52.326 A:middle
by prefixing it with
the software version

446
00:22:52.456 --> 00:22:53.366 A:middle
where we saw the problem.

447
00:22:53.366 --> 00:22:56.496 A:middle
Now this is especially
relevant for seed build,

448
00:22:57.106 --> 00:22:59.876 A:middle
'cause when we see the title
we can clearly and easily tell

449
00:23:00.346 --> 00:23:01.896 A:middle
that this problem
was encountered

450
00:23:01.896 --> 00:23:04.236 A:middle
in a seed build versus
a GM Build.

451
00:23:04.236 --> 00:23:10.006 A:middle
Next up, is the problem
details component.

452
00:23:10.006 --> 00:23:14.276 A:middle
When we talk about problem
details we mean be descriptive.

453
00:23:15.156 --> 00:23:19.006 A:middle
Remember, the engineer who's
reading your bug report was not

454
00:23:19.006 --> 00:23:20.986 A:middle
present with you when
the problem had happened.

455
00:23:21.496 --> 00:23:23.616 A:middle
They had not seen
what you had observed.

456
00:23:23.616 --> 00:23:28.226 A:middle
So tell them about it, and
this is the place to do that.

457
00:23:29.536 --> 00:23:33.266 A:middle
The problem details component
has five different subsections.

458
00:23:33.686 --> 00:23:36.716 A:middle
Let's talk about each
of them one at a time.

459
00:23:36.976 --> 00:23:41.276 A:middle
Start with summary, the problem
summary section is probably

460
00:23:41.276 --> 00:23:45.146 A:middle
recapping the title and
include some more descriptive

461
00:23:45.186 --> 00:23:46.316 A:middle
summary information.

462
00:23:47.216 --> 00:23:48.266 A:middle
What was going to?

463
00:23:48.556 --> 00:23:49.406 A:middle
What happened?

464
00:23:49.876 --> 00:23:51.826 A:middle
And why is it a problem?

465
00:23:52.946 --> 00:23:56.546 A:middle
If you encountered an error
message, this is a great place

466
00:23:56.806 --> 00:23:59.686 A:middle
to put the exact text
of the error message.

467
00:24:00.686 --> 00:24:04.066 A:middle
And so remember be specific.

468
00:24:04.066 --> 00:24:07.596 A:middle
Saying Safari is slow is
generally not good enough.

469
00:24:08.106 --> 00:24:11.026 A:middle
Is Safari slow compared
to other browsers?

470
00:24:11.296 --> 00:24:15.026 A:middle
Is Safari slow compared to
Safari on other machines?

471
00:24:15.026 --> 00:24:18.406 A:middle
Is Safari slow compared to
Safari's earlier versions?

472
00:24:19.016 --> 00:24:19.656 A:middle
Be specific.

473
00:24:20.046 --> 00:24:21.956 A:middle
Also use the correct
terminology?

474
00:24:22.696 --> 00:24:25.696 A:middle
If you're not sure what a
particular control is called,

475
00:24:26.116 --> 00:24:26.966 A:middle
use a screenshot.

476
00:24:27.636 --> 00:24:29.706 A:middle
Because that will tell
us exactly what it is.

477
00:24:31.086 --> 00:24:34.146 A:middle
So be precise and
avoid weird language,

478
00:24:35.066 --> 00:24:38.216 A:middle
saying nothing happens
does not communicate much.

479
00:24:38.806 --> 00:24:41.426 A:middle
Instead tell us what is
it that you did expect

480
00:24:41.566 --> 00:24:43.786 A:middle
to happen and did not happen.

481
00:24:44.796 --> 00:24:48.106 A:middle
So instead of saying nothing
happens when I try to print

482
00:24:48.106 --> 00:24:50.866 A:middle
from Safari, try
saying this instead,

483
00:24:51.616 --> 00:24:54.196 A:middle
the printer progress
dialog does not appear

484
00:24:54.196 --> 00:24:55.626 A:middle
after I select the print button.

485
00:24:56.326 --> 00:24:56.966 A:middle
That is much better.

486
00:24:56.966 --> 00:25:00.956 A:middle
So let's look at
an example summary

487
00:25:01.896 --> 00:25:03.146 A:middle
for the copy and paste problem.

488
00:25:03.466 --> 00:25:06.946 A:middle
We start out by recapping
the title which is great,

489
00:25:07.336 --> 00:25:10.576 A:middle
and then we add some other
observations that we had made

490
00:25:11.346 --> 00:25:12.356 A:middle
when the problem had occurred.

491
00:25:13.666 --> 00:25:14.276 A:middle
This is pretty good.

492
00:25:14.676 --> 00:25:17.906 A:middle
Next up is steps to reproduce.

493
00:25:18.496 --> 00:25:21.906 A:middle
The problem with steps
to reproduce is to think

494
00:25:21.906 --> 00:25:24.906 A:middle
of what it would take
to reproduce the issue

495
00:25:24.986 --> 00:25:27.436 A:middle
on a freshly set of
device of machine.

496
00:25:28.546 --> 00:25:31.536 A:middle
Pretend you're telling your mom
on how to reproduce the issue.

497
00:25:32.836 --> 00:25:35.896 A:middle
Put yourself in the shoes
of the engineer and think

498
00:25:35.896 --> 00:25:39.516 A:middle
about what is it that
they might need to know

499
00:25:39.796 --> 00:25:41.566 A:middle
to diagnose the problem
correctly.

500
00:25:41.566 --> 00:25:42.906 A:middle
So anticipate the sort

501
00:25:42.906 --> 00:25:44.626 A:middle
of questions they
might have for you.

502
00:25:45.616 --> 00:25:49.206 A:middle
Also remember do not make
assumptions about them knowing

503
00:25:49.206 --> 00:25:50.586 A:middle
about your application.

504
00:25:51.746 --> 00:25:52.616 A:middle
So be specific.

505
00:25:53.116 --> 00:25:56.536 A:middle
Instead of saying open the
file, tell us how is it

506
00:25:56.536 --> 00:25:57.456 A:middle
that you open the file.

507
00:25:57.786 --> 00:25:59.616 A:middle
Did you open the
file using finder?

508
00:25:59.616 --> 00:26:01.546 A:middle
Did you open the
file using terminal?

509
00:26:01.716 --> 00:26:03.726 A:middle
That might be a relevant
piece of information.

510
00:26:04.196 --> 00:26:05.236 A:middle
Always remember it's better

511
00:26:05.236 --> 00:26:06.936 A:middle
to include more information
than less.

512
00:26:07.866 --> 00:26:10.306 A:middle
So with that, let's
look at an example.

513
00:26:10.896 --> 00:26:13.306 A:middle
The same copy and paste
problem we've been working with.

514
00:26:13.306 --> 00:26:17.666 A:middle
So we start out fresh, we do not
make any assumptions of the code

515
00:26:17.736 --> 00:26:19.056 A:middle
that might have happened
before this.

516
00:26:19.546 --> 00:26:23.096 A:middle
We provide information
about how is it

517
00:26:23.546 --> 00:26:25.266 A:middle
that we perform the
copy operation.

518
00:26:25.656 --> 00:26:29.746 A:middle
Next up, we move onto how is it
we perform the paste operation.

519
00:26:29.746 --> 00:26:32.806 A:middle
We launch the Mail app,
select the compose button

520
00:26:33.776 --> 00:26:37.846 A:middle
and then select the paste button
that appears in the callout.

521
00:26:38.306 --> 00:26:42.836 A:middle
This is pretty good.

522
00:26:43.056 --> 00:26:45.696 A:middle
Next up, are the two
results sections,

523
00:26:45.756 --> 00:26:47.926 A:middle
expected results
and actual results.

524
00:26:49.006 --> 00:26:50.606 A:middle
Use these sections to specify,

525
00:26:50.606 --> 00:26:53.156 A:middle
what is it that you'd
expected to see?

526
00:26:53.416 --> 00:26:55.846 A:middle
And how was it different
from what you actually saw?

527
00:26:55.846 --> 00:26:59.586 A:middle
Now this piece of information
has actually very important,

528
00:26:59.586 --> 00:27:04.026 A:middle
because sometimes what you
expect might not be consistent

529
00:27:04.336 --> 00:27:05.936 A:middle
with what the engineer expects.

530
00:27:06.606 --> 00:27:10.226 A:middle
So by specifying this we can
clearly tell why you thought it

531
00:27:10.226 --> 00:27:12.086 A:middle
was a problem what had happened.

532
00:27:12.086 --> 00:27:16.116 A:middle
Let's look at an example.

533
00:27:16.756 --> 00:27:21.686 A:middle
Start out by specifying, what is
it that we did expect to happen?

534
00:27:22.316 --> 00:27:24.116 A:middle
Which was us being
able to paste image.

535
00:27:25.386 --> 00:27:28.076 A:middle
Then we specify what is
it that actually happened,

536
00:27:28.236 --> 00:27:30.366 A:middle
which was us ending
with an image,

537
00:27:30.736 --> 00:27:32.626 A:middle
containing a blue box
containing question mark.

538
00:27:33.646 --> 00:27:36.426 A:middle
Now it might not be clear
what is it that we mean

539
00:27:36.426 --> 00:27:39.806 A:middle
by this blue box
containing a question mark.

540
00:27:41.076 --> 00:27:45.356 A:middle
So in all these cases attaching
a screenshot is a great idea,

541
00:27:45.966 --> 00:27:48.666 A:middle
it will tell us exactly
what you saw.

542
00:27:49.166 --> 00:27:54.246 A:middle
With that let's talk about
the regression section.

543
00:27:54.766 --> 00:28:00.536 A:middle
Use a section to specify
when does the problem occur,

544
00:28:00.536 --> 00:28:02.556 A:middle
when does is it not occur?

545
00:28:03.276 --> 00:28:06.316 A:middle
So did the problem happen
in the first seed of iOS 7,

546
00:28:06.576 --> 00:28:09.846 A:middle
but did not happen
in iOS 6 and earlier.

547
00:28:11.006 --> 00:28:14.486 A:middle
Also does the problem go away
if the application is relaunched

548
00:28:14.746 --> 00:28:16.136 A:middle
or if the machine is rebooted?

549
00:28:17.016 --> 00:28:20.246 A:middle
All that is relevant information
for the regression section.

550
00:28:20.526 --> 00:28:22.816 A:middle
Let's look at an example.

551
00:28:23.596 --> 00:28:25.506 A:middle
We start out by specifying,

552
00:28:25.996 --> 00:28:27.856 A:middle
when is it that we
did see that problem?

553
00:28:28.216 --> 00:28:30.636 A:middle
Which is the iOS 6 seed.

554
00:28:31.506 --> 00:28:34.556 A:middle
Then move on to specifying
the software configuration

555
00:28:34.836 --> 00:28:36.566 A:middle
where we did not
see the problem,

556
00:28:36.566 --> 00:28:38.706 A:middle
which is iOS 5 and earlier.

557
00:28:39.756 --> 00:28:43.846 A:middle
We also provide some other base
we had not seen the problem

558
00:28:43.846 --> 00:28:45.896 A:middle
which was using an
alternative way

559
00:28:46.166 --> 00:28:48.006 A:middle
of performing the
copy operation.

560
00:28:48.546 --> 00:28:53.536 A:middle
Let's talk about
the next component

561
00:28:53.606 --> 00:28:55.146 A:middle
which is the additional
enclosures.

562
00:28:55.146 --> 00:29:00.526 A:middle
Now when you're filing a bug
report there might be extra

563
00:29:00.526 --> 00:29:03.986 A:middle
information that you
can attach to your bug

564
00:29:04.086 --> 00:29:09.046 A:middle
that will greatly help us
understand the problem a

565
00:29:09.046 --> 00:29:09.496 A:middle
lot quicker.

566
00:29:09.496 --> 00:29:15.716 A:middle
Now an example of that
is a sample project.

567
00:29:15.716 --> 00:29:18.106 A:middle
You see, when I find a
sample project attached

568
00:29:18.166 --> 00:29:20.936 A:middle
to a bug report it pretty
much feels like finding gold,

569
00:29:21.236 --> 00:29:22.076 A:middle
because these are awesome.

570
00:29:22.076 --> 00:29:24.296 A:middle
They are great for two reasons.

571
00:29:25.266 --> 00:29:29.266 A:middle
First, it helps you isolate
the problem to figure

572
00:29:29.266 --> 00:29:33.166 A:middle
out if it's an issue with
your code or with our API.

573
00:29:34.276 --> 00:29:38.766 A:middle
Second, it helps us understand
the problem a lot quicker,

574
00:29:39.356 --> 00:29:42.546 A:middle
because we have a focus
example to work with.

575
00:29:42.596 --> 00:29:44.656 A:middle
So sample projects are great.

576
00:29:45.196 --> 00:29:51.236 A:middle
In addition, there might be some
other logs that you can attach

577
00:29:51.656 --> 00:29:55.976 A:middle
that will greatly help us
diagnose the problem quicker.

578
00:29:56.056 --> 00:29:59.436 A:middle
Our online webpage has some
excellent documentation

579
00:29:59.706 --> 00:30:01.926 A:middle
on what sorts of
logs you can attach

580
00:30:02.156 --> 00:30:03.326 A:middle
to what sorts of problems.

581
00:30:03.356 --> 00:30:05.286 A:middle
And it also has detailed steps

582
00:30:05.896 --> 00:30:07.966 A:middle
on how you can go
about retrieving it.

583
00:30:08.536 --> 00:30:09.836 A:middle
Let's go through of few of them

584
00:30:10.536 --> 00:30:12.706 A:middle
that are common in
a lot of cases.

585
00:30:12.826 --> 00:30:15.286 A:middle
First up are crash logs.

586
00:30:16.256 --> 00:30:19.446 A:middle
So if you run into
a crash you may want

587
00:30:19.446 --> 00:30:20.986 A:middle
to attach the crash log.

588
00:30:21.436 --> 00:30:25.246 A:middle
To retrieve the crush log
for an iOS device start

589
00:30:25.246 --> 00:30:27.616 A:middle
by connecting the device
to your host machine.

590
00:30:27.756 --> 00:30:29.956 A:middle
And then sync it with iTunes.

591
00:30:30.866 --> 00:30:32.546 A:middle
This will transfer the log file

592
00:30:32.866 --> 00:30:35.696 A:middle
from your device to
your host machine.

593
00:30:35.906 --> 00:30:40.366 A:middle
So the next step is
to locate the log file

594
00:30:40.636 --> 00:30:41.666 A:middle
on your host machine.

595
00:30:42.296 --> 00:30:45.666 A:middle
Now, if you're using a MAC,
look under this location

596
00:30:45.666 --> 00:30:49.586 A:middle
which is the User Directory,
Library, Logs, CrashReporter,

597
00:30:49.586 --> 00:30:53.876 A:middle
MobileDevice, and then a folder
name corresponding to the device

598
00:30:53.876 --> 00:30:55.146 A:middle
where the issue had occurred.

599
00:30:55.996 --> 00:30:59.106 A:middle
You'll see files of this
format, there will be prefix

600
00:30:59.106 --> 00:31:02.486 A:middle
for the name of the application
of the process that had crashed.

601
00:31:03.016 --> 00:31:04.876 A:middle
And will also contain
a timestamp

602
00:31:05.186 --> 00:31:07.226 A:middle
from when the issue
had occurred.

603
00:31:07.226 --> 00:31:09.836 A:middle
So hopefully this will provide
you with enough information

604
00:31:10.416 --> 00:31:13.586 A:middle
on figuring out which is
the file you need to attach.

605
00:31:14.156 --> 00:31:18.596 A:middle
If you had connected your
device to a Windows machine,

606
00:31:18.596 --> 00:31:21.306 A:middle
it's the same steps, but
you just need to look

607
00:31:21.446 --> 00:31:22.636 A:middle
under a different location.

608
00:31:23.196 --> 00:31:30.646 A:middle
If you'd encountered the
crash on in OS X machine,

609
00:31:32.056 --> 00:31:36.116 A:middle
look under this location which
is the User directory, Library,

610
00:31:36.116 --> 00:31:40.686 A:middle
Logs, DiagnosticReports,
you should see the files

611
00:31:40.686 --> 00:31:41.866 A:middle
for the same sort of format.

612
00:31:42.276 --> 00:31:45.586 A:middle
They'll be prefix for the
crashing application process

613
00:31:45.586 --> 00:31:47.836 A:middle
name and will contain
the timestamp

614
00:31:47.866 --> 00:31:51.836 A:middle
from when the problem
had occurred.

615
00:31:52.026 --> 00:31:54.016 A:middle
Next up are console logs.

616
00:31:54.416 --> 00:31:57.726 A:middle
Now these logs are great
because they capture some really

617
00:31:57.726 --> 00:32:00.946 A:middle
important application and
system state information.

618
00:32:01.466 --> 00:32:03.966 A:middle
They might contain
some error information

619
00:32:03.966 --> 00:32:06.646 A:middle
that will help us understand
the problem quickly.

620
00:32:07.676 --> 00:32:10.166 A:middle
So to capture these
for iOS devices,

621
00:32:10.746 --> 00:32:15.186 A:middle
launch your Xcode organizer
window, select the console tab

622
00:32:15.186 --> 00:32:16.526 A:middle
from the left inside panel.

623
00:32:16.886 --> 00:32:18.576 A:middle
Reproduce the issue if you can,

624
00:32:19.316 --> 00:32:23.216 A:middle
and then save it using the Save
log as button at the bottom.

625
00:32:23.776 --> 00:32:27.596 A:middle
On OS X it's a bit different,

626
00:32:27.596 --> 00:32:31.346 A:middle
we use a different application
called console, it's located

627
00:32:31.346 --> 00:32:34.286 A:middle
under the Utilities folder of
your Applications Directory.

628
00:32:35.116 --> 00:32:39.896 A:middle
So once you launch it, you get
a window that looks like this.

629
00:32:40.196 --> 00:32:43.146 A:middle
Select the All Messages tab
from the left inside panel,

630
00:32:43.146 --> 00:32:46.386 A:middle
reproduce the issue if you can.

631
00:32:46.386 --> 00:32:49.596 A:middle
And then save it
using the Save a Copy

632
00:32:49.596 --> 00:32:51.266 A:middle
As option from the File menu.

633
00:32:54.076 --> 00:32:59.196 A:middle
Screenshots, now a picture
is worth a thousand words.

634
00:32:59.406 --> 00:33:03.816 A:middle
And this is especially relevant
when it comes to bug reports.

635
00:33:03.816 --> 00:33:07.366 A:middle
You see, you might have
run into a display issue

636
00:33:07.366 --> 00:33:09.956 A:middle
or a screen rendering
issue that is very hard

637
00:33:09.986 --> 00:33:11.136 A:middle
to describe using words.

638
00:33:11.556 --> 00:33:14.076 A:middle
Or as we had mentioned earlier,
you might have use the control

639
00:33:14.076 --> 00:33:15.976 A:middle
and you don't know
what it is called.

640
00:33:15.976 --> 00:33:18.386 A:middle
So use a screenshot in
all these scenarios.

641
00:33:19.256 --> 00:33:21.716 A:middle
To capture a screenshot
on an iOS device,

642
00:33:22.746 --> 00:33:25.816 A:middle
press and release the Power
and Home button together.

643
00:33:25.966 --> 00:33:28.356 A:middle
And that should save
the screenshot

644
00:33:28.356 --> 00:33:29.976 A:middle
as a photo in your photos app.

645
00:33:30.116 --> 00:33:33.636 A:middle
So you can go about retrieving
it using the usual ways

646
00:33:33.636 --> 00:33:35.906 A:middle
of either emailing it or
syncing it with iTunes.

647
00:33:35.906 --> 00:33:40.396 A:middle
There's an alternate
way you can use which is

648
00:33:40.466 --> 00:33:41.976 A:middle
to use the Xcode Organizer.

649
00:33:42.856 --> 00:33:46.116 A:middle
So select the screenshots tab
from the left inside panel

650
00:33:46.896 --> 00:33:49.466 A:middle
and then use the new
screenshot button at the bottom.

651
00:33:50.016 --> 00:33:54.886 A:middle
If you want to capture
a screenshot on OS X,

652
00:33:54.926 --> 00:33:57.296 A:middle
there are few different
commands depending

653
00:33:57.296 --> 00:33:58.796 A:middle
on what is it that
you want to do.

654
00:33:59.106 --> 00:34:02.666 A:middle
To capture the full screen,
use Command+Shift and 3.

655
00:34:02.666 --> 00:34:07.106 A:middle
To capture a part of the
screen use Command+Shift and 4,

656
00:34:07.806 --> 00:34:10.176 A:middle
and just specific window,
this is actually handy,

657
00:34:10.525 --> 00:34:12.746 A:middle
Command+Shift+4, and
then press the spacebar.

658
00:34:12.746 --> 00:34:16.686 A:middle
All these shortcuts save
an image on your desktop

659
00:34:17.166 --> 00:34:19.766 A:middle
that you can very easily
attach to your bug report.

660
00:34:20.216 --> 00:34:25.106 A:middle
You know sometimes
screenshots are not good enough.

661
00:34:25.786 --> 00:34:28.676 A:middle
Perhaps you're trying to
describe a sequence of events

662
00:34:29.235 --> 00:34:31.656 A:middle
or a bad animation or
something being slow.

663
00:34:32.806 --> 00:34:35.255 A:middle
In all these cases screen
recordings are great.

664
00:34:35.846 --> 00:34:40.706 A:middle
To capture a screen recording on
OS X, launch QuickTime Player,

665
00:34:40.976 --> 00:34:44.596 A:middle
select the New Screen Recording
option from the File menu,

666
00:34:45.346 --> 00:34:48.226 A:middle
select the start recording
button, reproduce the issue,

667
00:34:48.666 --> 00:34:52.146 A:middle
stop the recording you should
have a movie file you can very

668
00:34:52.146 --> 00:34:53.485 A:middle
easily attach to
your bug report.

669
00:34:53.896 --> 00:34:54.556 A:middle
This will be great.

670
00:34:55.126 --> 00:34:58.746 A:middle
Next up are snapshots.

671
00:34:59.686 --> 00:35:02.996 A:middle
You know, snapshots are
essentially a state snapshot

672
00:35:03.526 --> 00:35:05.656 A:middle
of all the processes
that we're running

673
00:35:05.886 --> 00:35:07.906 A:middle
at the time the snapshot
was captured.

674
00:35:08.866 --> 00:35:12.696 A:middle
So if you run into a performance
issue on an iOS device.

675
00:35:12.856 --> 00:35:14.626 A:middle
If something is slow

676
00:35:14.626 --> 00:35:17.236 A:middle
or something is just
stacked doing some task,

677
00:35:18.256 --> 00:35:19.176 A:middle
capture a snapshot.

678
00:35:19.176 --> 00:35:22.536 A:middle
In fact capture multiple
snapshots because since each

679
00:35:22.536 --> 00:35:26.036 A:middle
of these is a snapshot, we
might need multiple to figure

680
00:35:26.036 --> 00:35:28.456 A:middle
out what is exactly
causing the slowness.

681
00:35:28.456 --> 00:35:33.816 A:middle
So to capture a snapshot
on an iOS device,

682
00:35:34.906 --> 00:35:37.626 A:middle
press and release one
of the volume buttons

683
00:35:37.916 --> 00:35:39.186 A:middle
and the home button together.

684
00:35:40.346 --> 00:35:42.406 A:middle
This should create a
log file on your device

685
00:35:42.406 --> 00:35:46.706 A:middle
and use the same ways of
retrieval as a crash log.

686
00:35:47.096 --> 00:35:49.656 A:middle
So connect to your device,
to your host machine,

687
00:35:49.656 --> 00:35:53.516 A:middle
sync it with iTunes and
look under the same location

688
00:35:53.516 --> 00:35:55.426 A:middle
as you would for a crash log.

689
00:35:56.256 --> 00:35:58.836 A:middle
The log file will be
prefixed with the word stacks

690
00:35:59.596 --> 00:36:01.316 A:middle
and will contain the timestamp

691
00:36:01.316 --> 00:36:03.296 A:middle
from when the problem
had happened.

692
00:36:03.836 --> 00:36:07.836 A:middle
If you run into performance
issues

693
00:36:08.576 --> 00:36:11.816 A:middle
on OS X capture sample logs.

694
00:36:11.966 --> 00:36:13.416 A:middle
So if you notice
something is slow

695
00:36:13.416 --> 00:36:17.116 A:middle
or something is just stack doing
something, capture sample logs.

696
00:36:17.486 --> 00:36:21.496 A:middle
So launch your terminal window
and run sample with the name

697
00:36:21.496 --> 00:36:24.756 A:middle
of the application or process
that is behaving poorly.

698
00:36:25.546 --> 00:36:26.886 A:middle
Now that should all put a file

699
00:36:27.276 --> 00:36:29.596 A:middle
that you can very easily
attach to your bug report.

700
00:36:29.966 --> 00:36:33.676 A:middle
Another great tool
that is available

701
00:36:33.676 --> 00:36:35.026 A:middle
on OS X is sysdiagnose.

702
00:36:35.596 --> 00:36:39.066 A:middle
So, if you run into a
system performance issue

703
00:36:39.276 --> 00:36:41.766 A:middle
on OS X this will capture a lot

704
00:36:41.766 --> 00:36:43.646 A:middle
of very useful state
information.

705
00:36:43.646 --> 00:36:46.656 A:middle
So launch your terminal
window, type in sysdiagnose,

706
00:36:47.306 --> 00:36:48.586 A:middle
take a few minutes to run.

707
00:36:49.216 --> 00:36:53.086 A:middle
But by the end of it, you'll
have a collection of rich logs

708
00:36:53.336 --> 00:36:55.216 A:middle
that you can attach
to your bug report.

709
00:36:55.686 --> 00:37:01.896 A:middle
I have to admit, this is a lot
of work and it's probably going

710
00:37:01.896 --> 00:37:02.746 A:middle
to take a lot of time.

711
00:37:03.836 --> 00:37:07.056 A:middle
But even though collecting
this information,

712
00:37:07.326 --> 00:37:09.376 A:middle
sort of making the
sample project

713
00:37:09.376 --> 00:37:13.846 A:middle
or attaching these logs they
might be optional in some ways,

714
00:37:14.726 --> 00:37:17.666 A:middle
you might still want to spend
the time collecting this.

715
00:37:17.966 --> 00:37:22.406 A:middle
And let me convince you by
bringing back the good old time

716
00:37:22.406 --> 00:37:23.696 A:middle
versus probability graph.

717
00:37:24.396 --> 00:37:27.666 A:middle
You see when you attached
this additional information,

718
00:37:27.816 --> 00:37:29.806 A:middle
[inaudible] sort of moves up.

719
00:37:31.936 --> 00:37:34.286 A:middle
The chance is that
the bug will get fixed

720
00:37:34.346 --> 00:37:35.546 A:middle
for that particular release.

721
00:37:35.666 --> 00:37:38.376 A:middle
It goes up because
it's much easier for us

722
00:37:38.476 --> 00:37:40.806 A:middle
to understand the
seriousness of the issue.

723
00:37:41.196 --> 00:37:43.756 A:middle
Understand the issue
itself as well.

724
00:37:43.756 --> 00:37:47.866 A:middle
So the next time you're filing
a bug report, think about it,

725
00:37:47.866 --> 00:37:51.776 A:middle
whether to spend that extra
time collecting this information

726
00:37:52.726 --> 00:37:54.276 A:middle
in order to improve the chances.

727
00:37:54.766 --> 00:38:00.586 A:middle
With that, let's talk about
the configuration information

728
00:38:00.616 --> 00:38:02.106 A:middle
component of a bug report.

729
00:38:03.146 --> 00:38:06.186 A:middle
Use this section to
specify the software

730
00:38:06.186 --> 00:38:09.486 A:middle
and the hardware configuration
of the device or the machine

731
00:38:09.776 --> 00:38:10.886 A:middle
where you saw this problem.

732
00:38:12.176 --> 00:38:15.846 A:middle
So in iOS, this would be the
hardware model and version,

733
00:38:16.686 --> 00:38:18.506 A:middle
the exact software version.

734
00:38:18.506 --> 00:38:22.096 A:middle
Now, remember, sync iOS 6
is generally not good enough

735
00:38:22.166 --> 00:38:24.236 A:middle
because we shift
many different builds

736
00:38:24.316 --> 00:38:26.206 A:middle
of iOS 6 in the last year.

737
00:38:26.826 --> 00:38:29.256 A:middle
So, to find out the
exact version,

738
00:38:29.646 --> 00:38:33.266 A:middle
launch the settings app,
navigate to General-About

739
00:38:33.866 --> 00:38:35.286 A:middle
and look under the
version field.

740
00:38:35.286 --> 00:38:38.846 A:middle
You should find the exact string
corresponding to the build.

741
00:38:38.846 --> 00:38:43.446 A:middle
Also if there was any
other hardware involved

742
00:38:43.666 --> 00:38:46.856 A:middle
in this problem that you
saw specify information

743
00:38:46.856 --> 00:38:47.636 A:middle
about that as well.

744
00:38:47.906 --> 00:38:53.876 A:middle
On OS X the best way to capture
configuration information is

745
00:38:53.876 --> 00:38:55.946 A:middle
to use the system
information report.

746
00:38:56.256 --> 00:38:59.396 A:middle
And our online documentation
has some excellent steps

747
00:38:59.396 --> 00:39:01.776 A:middle
on how you can go about
collecting this information.

748
00:39:02.276 --> 00:39:05.516 A:middle
Last component, we're
going to talk

749
00:39:05.516 --> 00:39:07.456 A:middle
about is the reproducibility
section.

750
00:39:07.456 --> 00:39:11.516 A:middle
Use this section to
specify how often is it

751
00:39:11.586 --> 00:39:12.576 A:middle
that you see the problem.

752
00:39:12.776 --> 00:39:13.916 A:middle
Do you see it always?

753
00:39:14.226 --> 00:39:16.756 A:middle
Did it only happen once
and you never were able

754
00:39:16.756 --> 00:39:17.926 A:middle
to reproduce it again?

755
00:39:18.246 --> 00:39:21.346 A:middle
Even if you did not try
to reproduce the issue,

756
00:39:21.846 --> 00:39:25.136 A:middle
still tell us about that because
that is still a relevant piece

757
00:39:25.136 --> 00:39:25.966 A:middle
of information.

758
00:39:27.026 --> 00:39:28.996 A:middle
With that, we have
reached the end

759
00:39:28.996 --> 00:39:30.776 A:middle
of the bug reporting section.

760
00:39:31.156 --> 00:39:32.376 A:middle
But let's recap what we learned.

761
00:39:33.416 --> 00:39:35.576 A:middle
We talked about why bug
reports are important.

762
00:39:36.236 --> 00:39:39.656 A:middle
They are a direct communication
channel between you

763
00:39:39.656 --> 00:39:42.136 A:middle
and an Apple engineer
so that you can tell us

764
00:39:42.136 --> 00:39:44.516 A:middle
about the issues you've been
running into with our software

765
00:39:44.926 --> 00:39:47.386 A:middle
and we can address
those appropriately.

766
00:39:47.886 --> 00:39:49.766 A:middle
These bug reports are read

767
00:39:49.846 --> 00:39:53.316 A:middle
and very diligently
tracked by Apple engineers.

768
00:39:54.056 --> 00:39:56.986 A:middle
The timing is important in
filing these bug reports.

769
00:39:57.346 --> 00:39:59.266 A:middle
So file as early as possible.

770
00:40:00.096 --> 00:40:04.476 A:middle
Also start off with well
written actionable bug reports

771
00:40:04.736 --> 00:40:08.226 A:middle
that are clear, concise,
succinct,

772
00:40:08.226 --> 00:40:10.116 A:middle
informative and constructive.

773
00:40:10.826 --> 00:40:13.156 A:middle
We also talked about a few
things you should keep in mind

774
00:40:13.596 --> 00:40:15.986 A:middle
to improve the chances
of your bug getting fixed

775
00:40:16.176 --> 00:40:17.086 A:middle
in a particular release.

776
00:40:17.756 --> 00:40:20.696 A:middle
With that, I like to hand it
over to Ted who's going to talk

777
00:40:20.696 --> 00:40:22.716 A:middle
to us about Developer
Technical Support.

778
00:40:22.716 --> 00:40:23.236 A:middle
Thank you.

779
00:40:24.516 --> 00:40:26.826 A:middle
[ Applause ]

780
00:40:27.326 --> 00:40:28.046 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you Tanya.

781
00:40:30.116 --> 00:40:31.486 A:middle
So, I'm Ted Jucevic.

782
00:40:31.486 --> 00:40:32.766 A:middle
And I'm here to talk to you

783
00:40:32.766 --> 00:40:38.956 A:middle
about Developer Technical
Support.

784
00:40:39.406 --> 00:40:46.986 A:middle
So, Developer Technical
Support or DTS is a organization

785
00:40:46.986 --> 00:40:52.466 A:middle
of engineers that provide one
to one support of public APIs

786
00:40:53.296 --> 00:40:57.906 A:middle
through email with a guaranteed
response for developers

787
00:40:57.906 --> 00:41:03.466 A:middle
of our iOS, OS X and
MFi developer programs.

788
00:41:03.466 --> 00:41:04.926 A:middle
So, if you have question
about how

789
00:41:04.926 --> 00:41:08.466 A:middle
to integrate an Apple
technology or you have a bug

790
00:41:08.466 --> 00:41:12.526 A:middle
in your app you can't resolve,
or a code level question related

791
00:41:12.526 --> 00:41:16.256 A:middle
to the development of your iOS
app, Mac app or MFi accessory,

792
00:41:16.886 --> 00:41:20.376 A:middle
we can help by providing
best practice guidance on how

793
00:41:20.376 --> 00:41:22.616 A:middle
to use our APIs and
troubleshoot.

794
00:41:23.546 --> 00:41:26.176 A:middle
So, when should you contact DTS?

795
00:41:26.836 --> 00:41:28.076 A:middle
Before you contact DTS,

796
00:41:28.526 --> 00:41:31.506 A:middle
make sure you've read the
relevant documentation.

797
00:41:32.056 --> 00:41:33.676 A:middle
You've checked on
the forums to see

798
00:41:33.676 --> 00:41:37.146 A:middle
if your question has already
been answered by somebody else.

799
00:41:37.546 --> 00:41:39.976 A:middle
Write some test code.

800
00:41:40.436 --> 00:41:43.496 A:middle
And if appropriate,
do post your question

801
00:41:43.496 --> 00:41:44.706 A:middle
to the developer forums.

802
00:41:45.596 --> 00:41:50.276 A:middle
But if you still need help
after you've exhausted all

803
00:41:50.276 --> 00:41:52.976 A:middle
of the resources, contact DTS.

804
00:41:54.066 --> 00:41:58.556 A:middle
So, you've decided that
you're going to contact DTS.

805
00:41:58.556 --> 00:42:01.766 A:middle
To do that, what
you need to do is go

806
00:42:01.766 --> 00:42:05.576 A:middle
to
developer.apple.com/membercenter

807
00:42:06.186 --> 00:42:07.766 A:middle
and click on the technical link

808
00:42:08.456 --> 00:42:10.476 A:middle
in the developer
support section.

809
00:42:11.296 --> 00:42:13.646 A:middle
This will take you to a page
where you can request help.

810
00:42:14.336 --> 00:42:17.906 A:middle
Fill out and submit the
technical support web form.

811
00:42:18.676 --> 00:42:21.616 A:middle
And all follow up
correspondences

812
00:42:21.616 --> 00:42:23.286 A:middle
with DTS will be through email.

813
00:42:24.056 --> 00:42:28.066 A:middle
So, we need a lot of the same
information that is required

814
00:42:28.306 --> 00:42:29.966 A:middle
when filing a bug report.

815
00:42:31.106 --> 00:42:32.596 A:middle
An Xcode sample project,

816
00:42:34.126 --> 00:42:37.256 A:middle
Symbolicated Crash
Logs are all important.

817
00:42:37.606 --> 00:42:43.436 A:middle
Now, Symbolicated Crash Logs are
crash logs that have the symbols

818
00:42:44.036 --> 00:42:45.656 A:middle
so the memory addresses,

819
00:42:46.056 --> 00:42:49.276 A:middle
translated into human
readable function names

820
00:42:49.276 --> 00:42:50.346 A:middle
and my [phonetic] numbers.

821
00:42:51.736 --> 00:42:54.836 A:middle
Many times after somebody had
some Symbolicated Crash Log,

822
00:42:55.826 --> 00:42:58.016 A:middle
they look at it and they
can actually figure out how

823
00:42:58.016 --> 00:42:59.286 A:middle
to solve the problem themselves.

824
00:43:00.106 --> 00:43:02.836 A:middle
If not, when you
submit the support

825
00:43:02.836 --> 00:43:05.916 A:middle
for request make sure you
include the Symbolicated Crash

826
00:43:05.916 --> 00:43:11.126 A:middle
Log because if you have a
crash, we're going to need one.

827
00:43:11.286 --> 00:43:15.276 A:middle
So, I've told you about what
DTS does, how to contact DTS

828
00:43:15.576 --> 00:43:16.526 A:middle
and how to work with us.

829
00:43:17.116 --> 00:43:23.826 A:middle
Let me start off or end this
part by giving you some answers

830
00:43:23.906 --> 00:43:26.656 A:middle
to some common questions
that we get in DTS.

831
00:43:26.656 --> 00:43:28.866 A:middle
So, all these answers
are actually

832
00:43:28.866 --> 00:43:31.236 A:middle
in technical note
documents that we've written.

833
00:43:31.676 --> 00:43:35.976 A:middle
For example, the ones that
are list on this slide are

834
00:43:35.976 --> 00:43:41.246 A:middle
on the iOS Reference Library
for you to-- you can find 24/7.

835
00:43:42.186 --> 00:43:46.686 A:middle
The first one, iOS Debugging
Magic has a relative information

836
00:43:46.816 --> 00:43:49.336 A:middle
for both new and
expert developers

837
00:43:49.336 --> 00:43:51.396 A:middle
who are debugging
iOS applications.

838
00:43:51.846 --> 00:43:54.266 A:middle
And it's one that I would
highly recommend reading

839
00:43:54.266 --> 00:43:59.576 A:middle
if you have started debugging
your app, or your about to.

840
00:44:00.116 --> 00:44:01.956 A:middle
The second one, understanding

841
00:44:01.956 --> 00:44:04.476 A:middle
and analyzing iOS
application crash reports.

842
00:44:04.976 --> 00:44:08.276 A:middle
It's important because
it explains to you how

843
00:44:08.276 --> 00:44:12.896 A:middle
to symbolicate your crash logs
and also gives information

844
00:44:12.896 --> 00:44:15.756 A:middle
about common exceptions
or other information

845
00:44:16.266 --> 00:44:18.786 A:middle
about what may be
causing your crash.

846
00:44:19.626 --> 00:44:22.016 A:middle
The rest of these are also
important, I'm not going to go

847
00:44:22.016 --> 00:44:25.536 A:middle
into them for time, but
make sure, you know,

848
00:44:26.056 --> 00:44:27.396 A:middle
they're worth your
time to read them.

849
00:44:27.896 --> 00:44:31.216 A:middle
On the OS X side, we have
some similar documents set

850
00:44:31.216 --> 00:44:33.266 A:middle
that I also recommend
you take a look at,

851
00:44:33.266 --> 00:44:35.886 A:middle
if you're working on
an app on the Mac.

852
00:44:37.096 --> 00:44:40.516 A:middle
The Mac OS X Debugging Magic
is like the iOS version

853
00:44:41.016 --> 00:44:44.236 A:middle
where it has a treasure trove
of information for both novice

854
00:44:44.236 --> 00:44:47.916 A:middle
and expert developers, and
then of course the second one,

855
00:44:47.916 --> 00:44:50.536 A:middle
how to reproduce bugs report
against a Mac App Store.

856
00:44:51.276 --> 00:44:53.876 A:middle
Well, the title kind of explains
it completely for itself.

857
00:44:54.496 --> 00:44:56.876 A:middle
So, thank you very much.

858
00:44:57.246 --> 00:45:00.296 A:middle
With that let me hand
you back to Nahir.

859
00:45:03.906 --> 00:45:07.036 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So now, you've made your
app, got all the help you need

860
00:45:07.106 --> 00:45:09.256 A:middle
and you want to get to
it to your customers.

861
00:45:09.256 --> 00:45:13.666 A:middle
And you put it on the Mac App
Store or the iOS App Store.

862
00:45:14.326 --> 00:45:17.456 A:middle
So for that let's go on that.

863
00:45:18.086 --> 00:45:20.426 A:middle
First one is the section
that we're going to talk

864
00:45:20.426 --> 00:45:21.376 A:middle
about is the App Store.

865
00:45:21.446 --> 00:45:24.596 A:middle
So, we have a whole page for
developers at developer.com--

866
00:45:24.596 --> 00:45:27.046 A:middle
developer.apple.com/appstore.

867
00:45:27.746 --> 00:45:30.046 A:middle
And this is where you can learn
about our approval process

868
00:45:31.296 --> 00:45:33.626 A:middle
and exactly what we go about
when we're actually trying

869
00:45:33.626 --> 00:45:35.356 A:middle
to approve your app
to get on the Store.

870
00:45:36.456 --> 00:45:37.716 A:middle
There's also where
you can and figure

871
00:45:37.716 --> 00:45:38.936 A:middle
out what the guidelines are

872
00:45:38.936 --> 00:45:40.766 A:middle
on what's actually
allowed in the Store.

873
00:45:41.626 --> 00:45:44.086 A:middle
I recommend you check that out.

874
00:45:44.686 --> 00:45:46.476 A:middle
We all have some other
cool stuff here as well.

875
00:45:46.476 --> 00:45:48.726 A:middle
So, if you've ever been on a
website and you've seen those

876
00:45:48.726 --> 00:45:51.376 A:middle
on the iOS or on
the App Store links,

877
00:45:51.646 --> 00:45:54.416 A:middle
or you've seen this really
nice product images for our--

878
00:45:54.416 --> 00:45:56.416 A:middle
some of our products, you
can actually download all

879
00:45:56.416 --> 00:45:57.446 A:middle
that on this website.

880
00:45:57.916 --> 00:46:00.236 A:middle
You can get full
pictures of our products,

881
00:46:00.236 --> 00:46:01.316 A:middle
you can get to those links.

882
00:46:01.756 --> 00:46:03.986 A:middle
And we also have some guidelines
on how these things are going

883
00:46:03.986 --> 00:46:06.606 A:middle
to be used, so check that out.

884
00:46:07.336 --> 00:46:09.356 A:middle
There's also a really
nice contact form here,

885
00:46:09.356 --> 00:46:11.016 A:middle
if you have any questions
for the App Store.

886
00:46:11.486 --> 00:46:12.676 A:middle
So, I [inaudible] with
all these other ways,

887
00:46:12.676 --> 00:46:14.676 A:middle
there's one single
place you can go

888
00:46:14.676 --> 00:46:17.836 A:middle
for all your communication
with the App Store.

889
00:46:18.056 --> 00:46:20.536 A:middle
So, on this page, you can
get the status of your app.

890
00:46:20.596 --> 00:46:22.086 A:middle
So, if you've put it
in and you're trying

891
00:46:22.086 --> 00:46:23.826 A:middle
to see what's going
on, what's going

892
00:46:23.826 --> 00:46:25.406 A:middle
to review process,
this is where you go.

893
00:46:25.546 --> 00:46:28.516 A:middle
This is also where we
can get some-- get--

894
00:46:28.516 --> 00:46:31.616 A:middle
give us some clarification on
an app if it's got rejected.

895
00:46:31.686 --> 00:46:32.786 A:middle
Maybe someone miss something.

896
00:46:33.166 --> 00:46:35.936 A:middle
The app reviewers are people
and sometimes we make mistakes.

897
00:46:35.936 --> 00:46:37.986 A:middle
So this is where we can
also know what happened.

898
00:46:38.426 --> 00:46:41.506 A:middle
If your app has been rejected,
there's also where you can go

899
00:46:41.506 --> 00:46:43.946 A:middle
to start off with the
appeal process, because just

900
00:46:43.946 --> 00:46:46.986 A:middle
because your app has been
rejected doesn't mean they'll

901
00:46:46.986 --> 00:46:48.196 A:middle
never be allowed
in the App Store.

902
00:46:48.656 --> 00:46:51.076 A:middle
We can work together to get
back in there or get in there.

903
00:46:52.596 --> 00:46:56.096 A:middle
This is also where you go to
get an expedited app review.

904
00:46:56.766 --> 00:46:59.766 A:middle
So, if you have an app in
the App Store right now

905
00:47:00.026 --> 00:47:03.716 A:middle
and you notice there's a very
horrible crash and you needed

906
00:47:03.716 --> 00:47:06.446 A:middle
to get it out there, that's
where you can go to start that.

907
00:47:06.586 --> 00:47:10.306 A:middle
Now, just as warning, you can
do that for every single one

908
00:47:10.306 --> 00:47:13.466 A:middle
of your submissions to the App
Store because we kind of catch

909
00:47:13.466 --> 00:47:15.066 A:middle
on to that and we're
going to allow that.

910
00:47:15.366 --> 00:47:18.156 A:middle
This is also where you can go to
provide requested information.

911
00:47:18.506 --> 00:47:22.396 A:middle
So, say we want to host
your app or feature it,

912
00:47:22.396 --> 00:47:24.626 A:middle
this is where you can add some
information for there as well.

913
00:47:25.056 --> 00:47:28.156 A:middle
Next we're going
to iTunes Connect.

914
00:47:29.126 --> 00:47:31.576 A:middle
And I'm sure many of
you are very familiar

915
00:47:31.576 --> 00:47:32.426 A:middle
with iTunes Connect.

916
00:47:33.386 --> 00:47:36.066 A:middle
This is where you go
to handle everything

917
00:47:36.066 --> 00:47:39.376 A:middle
about managing your app and
the business of your app.

918
00:47:39.706 --> 00:47:41.686 A:middle
This is where you can go
on to see your sales trends

919
00:47:41.686 --> 00:47:42.736 A:middle
to see what's going on there.

920
00:47:42.736 --> 00:47:46.046 A:middle
This is also where you can go to
setup all your contracts and all

921
00:47:46.046 --> 00:47:47.586 A:middle
of your little tax information

922
00:47:47.586 --> 00:47:48.906 A:middle
and all the other
stuff that you can do.

923
00:47:48.906 --> 00:47:52.616 A:middle
This is also where can go to
setup iAd and all those stuff

924
00:47:52.886 --> 00:47:55.736 A:middle
that you need to get
ready to have ads in

925
00:47:55.976 --> 00:47:57.096 A:middle
and deal with the ad process.

926
00:47:58.096 --> 00:48:02.316 A:middle
And also you can go in to
get In-App purchases and how

927
00:48:02.316 --> 00:48:03.706 A:middle
to set those things up as well.

928
00:48:04.206 --> 00:48:07.396 A:middle
Now, iTunes Mac is huge

929
00:48:07.716 --> 00:48:09.996 A:middle
and there's some questions
that you might have.

930
00:48:10.656 --> 00:48:12.656 A:middle
So, there is a frequently
asked questions phase there

931
00:48:12.726 --> 00:48:14.136 A:middle
and I highly recommend
you check it out.

932
00:48:14.136 --> 00:48:15.906 A:middle
There are a lot of
good information here

933
00:48:15.906 --> 00:48:17.926 A:middle
and you have a question there's
a very good chance that's

934
00:48:17.926 --> 00:48:18.716 A:middle
answered right there.

935
00:48:18.716 --> 00:48:23.976 A:middle
But if you don't want to go
through, you can also check

936
00:48:23.976 --> 00:48:25.216 A:middle
out the Contact Us Page.

937
00:48:25.446 --> 00:48:27.806 A:middle
And it's kind of nice because
got to hold drill down menu.

938
00:48:28.596 --> 00:48:32.406 A:middle
So, in this case, I'm Canadian
actually, so I'm trying

939
00:48:32.406 --> 00:48:35.306 A:middle
to figure out what's going on
to get my, like Canadian deals

940
00:48:35.306 --> 00:48:38.336 A:middle
and tax information and all
that, I can actually go in there

941
00:48:38.336 --> 00:48:40.026 A:middle
and say, oh, I will
have something

942
00:48:40.026 --> 00:48:43.666 A:middle
with the tax information and
I'm for-- kind the tax forms.

943
00:48:43.666 --> 00:48:45.726 A:middle
And it tells me exactly
what I am to do

944
00:48:45.826 --> 00:48:47.236 A:middle
and where I can get
more information.

945
00:48:47.916 --> 00:48:50.316 A:middle
It also gives me some related
frequently asked questions

946
00:48:50.316 --> 00:48:51.926 A:middle
pages, so you can
check that out as well.

947
00:48:52.486 --> 00:49:00.006 A:middle
Now, iTunes Connect as I
mentioned is a very large area,

948
00:49:00.006 --> 00:49:03.736 A:middle
so we actually have gigantic
guidelines here, both for iOS

949
00:49:03.786 --> 00:49:09.046 A:middle
and Mac developers and I highly
recommend you check these out.

950
00:49:09.396 --> 00:49:10.896 A:middle
They go step by step on how

951
00:49:11.506 --> 00:49:15.706 A:middle
to do multiple different
things in iTunes Connect.

952
00:49:17.376 --> 00:49:22.316 A:middle
So with that, coming to the end
of our presentation, so today,

953
00:49:22.846 --> 00:49:25.086 A:middle
hopefully we got a
bit of understanding

954
00:49:25.086 --> 00:49:26.966 A:middle
of all the different developer
resources that are available

955
00:49:26.966 --> 00:49:30.186 A:middle
to you and when you
should actually use them.

956
00:49:30.186 --> 00:49:34.976 A:middle
So we went over, saw the ones
that are great for helping--

957
00:49:34.976 --> 00:49:38.796 A:middle
getting help yourself,
also a bunch of resources

958
00:49:39.006 --> 00:49:39.916 A:middle
when you're working with Apple

959
00:49:40.726 --> 00:49:43.446 A:middle
and also all the
resources available to you

960
00:49:43.506 --> 00:49:47.146 A:middle
for when you are
deploying your app.

961
00:49:47.406 --> 00:49:51.126 A:middle
We also went in-depth into
the importance of bug reports.

962
00:49:51.706 --> 00:49:53.256 A:middle
We gave you a little
behind scenes of what goes

963
00:49:53.256 --> 00:49:55.636 A:middle
on with Apple engineers
when we're looking at them

964
00:49:55.636 --> 00:49:58.336 A:middle
and we gave you some
really good tips on how

965
00:49:58.336 --> 00:49:59.586 A:middle
to file some really great ones.

966
00:50:00.196 --> 00:50:04.436 A:middle
We got some links here about
some of the places or some

967
00:50:04.436 --> 00:50:05.686 A:middle
of the things that we discuss.

968
00:50:05.886 --> 00:50:07.626 A:middle
So your dev forums, app review,

969
00:50:08.466 --> 00:50:14.206 A:middle
etc. And here's some
excellent links

970
00:50:14.256 --> 00:50:20.036 A:middle
to some technical tech notes
that Jed had mentioned, Ted.

971
00:50:20.456 --> 00:50:24.036 A:middle
And here's some for
the OS X as well.

972
00:50:24.196 --> 00:50:26.706 A:middle
I hope you've had
a wonderful WWDC.

973
00:50:26.706 --> 00:50:28.906 A:middle
I hope to see you
guys again soon.

974
00:50:29.516 --> 00:50:32.500 A:middle
