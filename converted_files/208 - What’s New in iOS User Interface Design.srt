00:00:17.256 --> 00:00:21.066 A:middle
This session is What's New
in iOS User Interface Design.

00:00:21.756 --> 00:00:23.646 A:middle
And I want to thank so
many of you for caring

6
00:00:23.646 --> 00:00:26.226 A:middle
about software design, for
being here at nine o'clock

7
00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:27.616 A:middle
in the morning to talk

8
00:00:27.616 --> 00:00:30.486 A:middle
about this topic that's
very important to us.

9
00:00:30.486 --> 00:00:32.055 A:middle
If this were another company

10
00:00:32.055 --> 00:00:34.196 A:middle
and if this were another
developer conference,

11
00:00:34.946 --> 00:00:40.736 A:middle
I might imagine a full room
could be a session like this

12
00:00:40.856 --> 00:00:44.516 A:middle
but it's not, we are Apple,
we care about software design,

13
00:00:45.156 --> 00:00:47.336 A:middle
and this is what this
session is about.

14
00:00:47.336 --> 00:00:53.706 A:middle
[Applause] So why don't you
guys give yourself a hand.

00:00:54.676 --> 00:00:56.516 A:middle
I'm Greg Christie and I'm here

16
00:00:56.516 --> 00:01:00.156 A:middle
to introduce Mike Stern
eventually and talk

17
00:01:00.156 --> 00:01:02.176 A:middle
about what the new
user interface means

18
00:01:02.176 --> 00:01:03.146 A:middle
to you as developers.

19
00:01:03.486 --> 00:01:08.046 A:middle
I thought the keynote
went great.

20
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:09.616 A:middle
I hope you guys all enjoyed it.

21
00:01:09.996 --> 00:01:13.956 A:middle
You guys have been playing with
iOS 7 for a day and a half now

22
00:01:14.556 --> 00:01:16.526 A:middle
and so I thought it would be
a really great way to start

23
00:01:16.526 --> 00:01:23.466 A:middle
if we take a fresh look at
Jony's words and the video now

24
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:25.696 A:middle
that you've used iOS
7 for a day and a half

25
00:01:25.696 --> 00:01:29.526 A:middle
and can get some context into
what he was talking about.

26
00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:34.746 A:middle
So, I'd like to start with that.

27
00:01:34.746 --> 00:01:36.276 A:middle
[ Music ]

28
00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:53.096 A:middle
&gt;&gt; We have always thought of
design as being so much more

29
00:01:53.826 --> 00:01:56.816 A:middle
than just the way
something looks.

30
00:01:56.816 --> 00:01:57.696 A:middle
It's the whole thing.

31
00:01:57.766 --> 00:02:05.586 A:middle
The way something actually works
on so many different levels.

32
00:02:05.806 --> 00:02:07.936 A:middle
Ultimately, of course,
design defines

33
00:02:07.936 --> 00:02:19.966 A:middle
so much of our experience.

[ Music ]

35
00:02:20.033 --> 00:02:26.856 A:middle
I think there is a profound and
enduring beauty in simplicity,

36
00:02:26.856 --> 00:02:28.826 A:middle
in clarity, in efficiency.

37
00:02:28.826 --> 00:02:33.796 A:middle
True simplicity is
derived from so much more

38
00:02:33.796 --> 00:02:39.246 A:middle
than just the absence of
clutter and ornamentation.

39
00:02:39.776 --> 00:02:42.616 A:middle
It's about bringing
order to complexity.

[ Music ]

41
00:02:48.096 --> 00:02:57.106 A:middle
iOS 7 is a clear
representation of these goals.

42
00:02:57.106 --> 00:03:00.856 A:middle
It has a whole new
structure that is coherent

43
00:03:01.336 --> 00:03:08.166 A:middle
and it is applied
across the entire system.

[ Music ]

45
00:03:08.566 --> 00:03:12.386 A:middle
We've considered
the tiniest details,

46
00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:21.586 A:middle
like refining the
typography, to much larger ones

47
00:03:21.586 --> 00:03:23.386 A:middle
like redesigning all the icons,

48
00:03:23.846 --> 00:03:28.306 A:middle
and developing a grid
system allowed us

49
00:03:28.306 --> 00:03:31.496 A:middle
to achieve a much more
harmonious relationship

50
00:03:31.756 --> 00:03:34.046 A:middle
between individual elements.

51
00:03:34.356 --> 00:03:41.906 A:middle
We've also incorporated a
whole new palette of colors.

53
00:03:42.266 --> 00:03:50.876 A:middle

[ Music ]

55
00:03:50.996 --> 00:03:58.546 A:middle
And the use of translucency
gives you a sense

56
00:03:59.076 --> 00:04:01.066 A:middle
of your context.

57
00:04:01.606 --> 00:04:06.036 A:middle
These planes, combined with
new approaches to animation

58
00:04:06.216 --> 00:04:10.306 A:middle
and motion, create a sense
of depth and vitality.

60
00:04:10.496 --> 00:04:19.796 A:middle
The iPhone responding to your
movements drives the parallax

to create a whole new
experience of depth.

[ Music ]

63
00:04:21.973 --> 00:04:26.336 A:middle
In many ways, we've tried
to create an interface

64
00:04:26.456 --> 00:04:34.646 A:middle
that is unobtrusive
and deferential.

65
00:04:34.646 --> 00:04:39.626 A:middle
One where the design
recedes and in doing

66
00:04:39.626 --> 00:04:44.146 A:middle
so actually elevates
your content.

67
00:04:44.216 --> 00:04:51.236 A:middle
Even the simple act of changing
your wallpaper has a very

68
00:04:51.236 --> 00:04:57.726 A:middle
noticeable effect on the way
your iPhone looks and feels

69
00:04:57.916 --> 00:05:00.466 A:middle
across the entire system.

[ Music ]

71
00:05:01.056 --> 00:05:08.686 A:middle
While iOS 7 is completely
new, it was important to us

72
00:05:09.146 --> 00:05:10.956 A:middle
to make it instantly familiar.

73

[ Music ]

74
00:05:12.776 --> 00:05:20.186 A:middle
We wanted to take an experience
the people know very well

75
00:05:20.226 --> 00:05:25.556 A:middle
and actually add to it
to make it more useful,

76
00:05:25.676 --> 00:05:27.656 A:middle
to make enjoyable.

77
00:05:28.516 --> 00:05:31.816 A:middle
To create it, we brought
together a broad range

78
00:05:31.956 --> 00:05:35.256 A:middle
of expertise from
design to engineering.

79
00:05:37.206 --> 00:05:41.686 A:middle
With what we've been able to
achieve together, we see iOS 7

80
00:05:42.976 --> 00:05:45.416 A:middle
as defining an important
new direction,

81
00:05:45.846 --> 00:05:55.156 A:middle

What's new in iOS 7?

00:06:05.236 --> 00:06:07.676 A:middle
Well, everything is new.

It's a 100 percent
new pixels there.

88

No pixel here has
been used before

in any previous release of iOS.

90
00:06:16.996 --> 00:06:20.866 A:middle
A really great example to look
at when we talk about what's new

91
00:06:20.866 --> 00:06:24.396 A:middle
in iOS 7 and where we're
headed is the Weather app.

92
00:06:25.436 --> 00:06:26.496 A:middle
It's not the most important app

93
00:06:26.496 --> 00:06:29.586 A:middle
on the phone unless you really
need to know what the weather is

94
00:06:29.586 --> 00:06:30.986 A:middle
and it's not the most used app,

95
00:06:30.986 --> 00:06:34.576 A:middle
but it really gives
a great indication

96
00:06:34.576 --> 00:06:36.576 A:middle
of what we're doing with iOS 7.

97
00:06:37.156 --> 00:06:41.176 A:middle
You guys by now are familiar

98
00:06:41.176 --> 00:06:42.946 A:middle
with the animated
weather states,

99
00:06:43.456 --> 00:06:44.946 A:middle
how they occupy the
full display.

100
00:06:47.866 --> 00:06:53.566 A:middle
It's really interesting
comparing old and new side

101
00:06:53.566 --> 00:06:55.646 A:middle
by side and you can see a lot

102
00:06:55.646 --> 00:06:58.006 A:middle
of what we were doing is
maximizing the screen size,

103
00:06:58.406 --> 00:07:03.626 A:middle
blowing out the edges, removing
unnecessary edges and borders,

104
00:07:04.266 --> 00:07:06.876 A:middle
refining the typography,
refining the line work,

105
00:07:08.166 --> 00:07:10.906 A:middle
really just creating a whole
new immersive experience.

106
00:07:11.536 --> 00:07:13.786 A:middle
The graphical ornamentation
is now an intrinsic part

107
00:07:13.786 --> 00:07:14.586 A:middle
of the application.

108
00:07:14.826 --> 00:07:16.076 A:middle
It's not just tacked on.

109
00:07:17.196 --> 00:07:20.156 A:middle
Okay? You can see
all those things here

110
00:07:20.476 --> 00:07:24.066 A:middle
in detail compared to that.

111
00:07:25.016 --> 00:07:25.896 A:middle
It's really interesting.

112
00:07:29.596 --> 00:07:33.676 A:middle
Johnny touches on four
key notions in the video

113
00:07:33.976 --> 00:07:36.276 A:middle
and that's what we're going
to talk about here today,

114
00:07:36.706 --> 00:07:38.476 A:middle
because when everything has
changed it's hard to know

115
00:07:38.476 --> 00:07:41.086 A:middle
where to start, so we'll
start with the simplest notion

116
00:07:41.086 --> 00:07:42.036 A:middle
and that's one of clarity.

117
00:07:42.676 --> 00:07:45.036 A:middle
Clarity simply put
is being clear.

118
00:07:45.636 --> 00:07:49.986 A:middle
In the Weather app we're
very clear in terms

119
00:07:49.986 --> 00:07:51.626 A:middle
of what the temperature is

120
00:07:51.626 --> 00:07:53.026 A:middle
and what the current
weather conditions are.

121
00:07:53.026 --> 00:07:57.296 A:middle
We make the current temperature
as large as possible,

122
00:07:58.256 --> 00:08:01.366 A:middle
yet fit in a sound design with
the rest of the information.

123
00:08:02.716 --> 00:08:06.216 A:middle
Being clear means clearly
indicating what's text

124
00:08:06.726 --> 00:08:08.826 A:middle
and what's a control,
what's content

125
00:08:09.106 --> 00:08:13.086 A:middle
and what's a control layer.

126
00:08:14.016 --> 00:08:17.586 A:middle
Another important concept
is this of deference, right.

127
00:08:18.396 --> 00:08:21.486 A:middle
So what we're doing in our apps
now is deferring to the content.

128
00:08:21.486 --> 00:08:24.656 A:middle
We're letting photos be
photos, web pages be web pages,

129
00:08:25.636 --> 00:08:27.806 A:middle
email messages be
email messages,

130
00:08:28.286 --> 00:08:29.796 A:middle
but there's another
side of deference.

131
00:08:30.356 --> 00:08:32.866 A:middle
This is very important
for you folks and that's

132
00:08:32.905 --> 00:08:38.876 A:middle
that iOS now has a design that
defers to your apps, okay?

133
00:08:39.206 --> 00:08:43.956 A:middle
We're not putting a really
strong visual imprint

134
00:08:44.275 --> 00:08:46.396 A:middle
on the overall system
so that your apps,

135
00:08:46.396 --> 00:08:49.396 A:middle
if you're doing custom UI, will
feel out of place on the system.

136
00:08:49.806 --> 00:08:51.616 A:middle
Our UI is now getting
out of the way,

137
00:08:51.886 --> 00:08:53.526 A:middle
we're letting your
apps be your apps

138
00:08:53.816 --> 00:08:56.036 A:middle
and letting the customer's
content be the

139
00:08:56.036 --> 00:08:57.016 A:middle
customer's content.

140
00:08:57.456 --> 00:09:01.366 A:middle
Another way that we're
reinforcing clarity

141
00:09:01.816 --> 00:09:04.316 A:middle
and this difference between
controls and content,

142
00:09:04.536 --> 00:09:05.666 A:middle
is by our use of depth.

143
00:09:06.116 --> 00:09:09.446 A:middle
You see this really strongly
in the case of the Home screen.

144
00:09:10.506 --> 00:09:12.756 A:middle
We're using this layering
model and we're using layers

145
00:09:12.756 --> 00:09:14.856 A:middle
and notification center
and control center

146
00:09:14.856 --> 00:09:16.806 A:middle
and within the individual
apps themselves.

147
00:09:17.706 --> 00:09:21.556 A:middle
Having controls exist on one
layer, content exist on another.

148
00:09:24.196 --> 00:09:25.416 A:middle
Finally, detail.

149
00:09:27.996 --> 00:09:31.286 A:middle
Detail really shows itself
in terms of topography,

150
00:09:31.286 --> 00:09:39.596 A:middle
using a consistent and coherent
set of weights and sizes

151
00:09:40.126 --> 00:09:45.686 A:middle
and in colors and
in the iconography.

152
00:09:46.236 --> 00:09:50.286 A:middle
Again, we're using a highly
disciplined, controlled,

153
00:09:50.336 --> 00:09:55.276 A:middle
limited set of colors yet it
provides a very rich pallet

154
00:09:55.276 --> 00:09:59.786 A:middle
and one that can express you
know just the incredible variety

155
00:09:59.786 --> 00:10:01.456 A:middle
of apps that are on iOS.

156
00:10:02.416 --> 00:10:04.516 A:middle
This also applies to the
Glyphs, things that appear

157
00:10:04.516 --> 00:10:06.476 A:middle
in button bars, toolbars,
those types of things.

158
00:10:06.996 --> 00:10:08.596 A:middle
These have all been
normalized with regard

159
00:10:08.596 --> 00:10:11.186 A:middle
to line weight and
shape and size.

160
00:10:12.676 --> 00:10:14.716 A:middle
Paying attention to
the details matters.

161
00:10:15.276 --> 00:10:17.256 A:middle
It matters a lot.

162
00:10:18.586 --> 00:10:20.926 A:middle
Another thing that
we're doing with regard

163
00:10:20.986 --> 00:10:24.606 A:middle
to detail is we're finally
exploiting the retina screens

164
00:10:24.606 --> 00:10:26.296 A:middle
to their, you know,
fullest capability.

165
00:10:26.656 --> 00:10:29.436 A:middle
We've lots of single pixel
details, single pixel lines

166
00:10:29.436 --> 00:10:31.826 A:middle
that we're using and exploiting
throughout the system.

167
00:10:35.906 --> 00:10:38.786 A:middle
Okay? So here to walk you
through the nuts and bolts

168
00:10:38.786 --> 00:10:41.196 A:middle
of what we did and some of
what you will have to do

169
00:10:41.376 --> 00:10:45.656 A:middle
to bring your apps into the
iOS 7 world is Mike Stern.

170
00:10:45.656 --> 00:10:50.526 A:middle
He's going to walk you
through some of these things.

171
00:10:51.026 --> 00:10:53.246 A:middle
[Applause]

172
00:10:53.746 --> 00:10:54.486 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Mike Stern: Thank you Greg.

173
00:10:56.506 --> 00:10:59.706 A:middle
I'm really excited to be
with you this morning to go

174
00:10:59.706 --> 00:11:03.406 A:middle
into some detail about iOS
7 and some of the new apps

X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:181083,LOCAL:00:00:00.000

176
00:12:00.256 --> 00:12:01.916 A:middle
with really great restraint.

177
00:12:02.996 --> 00:12:04.966 A:middle
We had to make sure that
anything that was added

178
00:12:04.966 --> 00:12:07.306 A:middle
to this was absolutely
necessary.

179
00:12:08.696 --> 00:12:11.936 A:middle
So eventually started adding
things like date and sender

180
00:12:11.966 --> 00:12:15.956 A:middle
but again it was secondary
to what mattered most.

181
00:12:20.176 --> 00:12:23.796 A:middle
Eventually we added controls
but we did so in a way

182
00:12:24.126 --> 00:12:28.656 A:middle
that didn't interfere with
your ability to read text.

183
00:12:29.086 --> 00:12:33.246 A:middle
It doesn't take much to make
these controls available

184
00:12:33.616 --> 00:12:36.086 A:middle
and legible, easy to access.

185
00:12:36.266 --> 00:12:39.806 A:middle
Now you've got to do a
little bit more than that

186
00:12:39.806 --> 00:12:43.356 A:middle
so color got added
at a later stage just

187
00:12:43.356 --> 00:12:45.166 A:middle
to distinguish controls
from content.

188
00:12:45.776 --> 00:12:48.736 A:middle
Some background colors,
a couple of crisp lines

189
00:12:49.876 --> 00:12:54.016 A:middle
but at all times the message
stayed present, it stayed front

190
00:12:54.016 --> 00:12:56.146 A:middle
and center, it was
the star of the show.

191
00:12:56.766 --> 00:13:00.126 A:middle
Then this is the
final design for Mail.

192
00:13:00.676 --> 00:13:03.676 A:middle
As you can see when photos
were added they were made to be

193
00:13:03.726 --> 00:13:06.916 A:middle
as large as possible so that
you can see as much detail

194
00:13:06.916 --> 00:13:10.696 A:middle
as possible without having to
pinch to zoom quite so much.

195
00:13:11.266 --> 00:13:17.306 A:middle
Now this focus in
starting with type first,

196
00:13:17.646 --> 00:13:20.516 A:middle
that really prioritized
type for us

197
00:13:20.866 --> 00:13:23.616 A:middle
and I don't think this will come
as a big shock to anybody here,

198
00:13:23.616 --> 00:13:26.136 A:middle
Apple has always
been deeply committed

199
00:13:26.426 --> 00:13:29.816 A:middle
to making the displayed and
the printed word as legible

200
00:13:29.816 --> 00:13:31.766 A:middle
as possible and gorgeous.

201
00:13:32.306 --> 00:13:38.246 A:middle
So that's how dynamic type came
about and there's a lot of stuff

202
00:13:38.246 --> 00:13:41.896 A:middle
in dynamic type and I'm sure you
guys have already heard quite a

203
00:13:41.896 --> 00:13:44.386 A:middle
bit about it in previous
sessions, but I want to focus

204
00:13:44.386 --> 00:13:47.916 A:middle
on two aspects of that,
scaling and styles.

205
00:13:48.676 --> 00:13:50.786 A:middle
Let's start with text scaling.

206
00:13:52.446 --> 00:13:57.026 A:middle
Now a big part of legibility
is the size of type.

207
00:13:57.686 --> 00:14:00.666 A:middle
I've worked as an interface
designer for 17 years

208
00:14:01.086 --> 00:14:03.296 A:middle
and I've worked on countless
projects and probably

209
00:14:03.296 --> 00:14:06.086 A:middle
on every single one type
was a big component of it,

210
00:14:06.726 --> 00:14:09.896 A:middle
and you know I or my team
would develop designs

211
00:14:09.896 --> 00:14:13.096 A:middle
and we would show them
to stakeholders, clients

212
00:14:13.486 --> 00:14:15.706 A:middle
and you'd always get this
diversity of reactions.

213
00:14:16.566 --> 00:14:19.546 A:middle
"I'm getting too old, my eyes
ain't what they used to be

214
00:14:19.546 --> 00:14:24.466 A:middle
and this is really hard to read"
or you know, "make text smaller,

215
00:14:24.646 --> 00:14:27.326 A:middle
it's truncating too quickly,
there's not enough controls,

216
00:14:27.326 --> 00:14:29.746 A:middle
I want to see more stuff
because it's more powerful

217
00:14:29.746 --> 00:14:31.776 A:middle
and I can deal with all
of that complexity."

218
00:14:33.026 --> 00:14:36.986 A:middle
And it's impossible to satisfy
both ends of that spectrum.

219
00:14:37.256 --> 00:14:37.886 A:middle
How do you do it?

220
00:14:37.886 --> 00:14:40.256 A:middle
You normally had to
pick one size of type.

221
00:14:40.256 --> 00:14:42.896 A:middle
I mean maybe you could build
some kind of custom thing

222
00:14:42.896 --> 00:14:43.946 A:middle
that allowed text to scale

223
00:14:43.946 --> 00:14:47.286 A:middle
but it was prohibitively
expensive engineering-wise,

224
00:14:48.016 --> 00:14:53.716 A:middle
and the results probably
would not be very good.

225
00:14:53.716 --> 00:14:57.246 A:middle
Dynamic type is game changing
because it allows for that

226
00:14:57.246 --> 00:14:59.136 A:middle
and it's really easy to use.

227
00:15:03.116 --> 00:15:06.296 A:middle
You have a huge diversity
of sizes to choose from

228
00:15:06.846 --> 00:15:10.316 A:middle
and with the accessibility
mode you can have,

229
00:15:10.496 --> 00:15:11.686 A:middle
you know, massive text.

230
00:15:12.256 --> 00:15:12.926 A:middle
It's really great.

231
00:15:14.106 --> 00:15:16.836 A:middle
But simply scaling type,
this is Helvetica Neue Light,

232
00:15:17.836 --> 00:15:19.496 A:middle
which looks really
awesome when it's big

233
00:15:19.496 --> 00:15:23.196 A:middle
but when it's small it
doesn't work very well.

234
00:15:23.196 --> 00:15:24.156 A:middle
It's not very legible.

235
00:15:24.156 --> 00:15:25.426 A:middle
The letter forms are very thin.

236
00:15:25.426 --> 00:15:26.246 A:middle
They're very delicate.

237
00:15:26.826 --> 00:15:32.866 A:middle
So to resolve for that,
to solve for that,

238
00:15:33.086 --> 00:15:37.126 A:middle
you can make small type bold
but that results in large type

239
00:15:37.616 --> 00:15:41.356 A:middle
which looks heavy and cumbersome
so this isn't very good either.

240
00:15:42.856 --> 00:15:47.396 A:middle
So dynamic type dynamically
makes text heavier

241
00:15:47.476 --> 00:15:50.226 A:middle
when it's smaller and
thinner when it's lighter.

242
00:15:50.646 --> 00:15:52.256 A:middle
Has a range of about
two weights.

243
00:15:52.746 --> 00:15:56.646 A:middle
As a result text has
this great continuity.

244
00:15:56.646 --> 00:15:58.136 A:middle
It looks great at every size,

245
00:15:58.776 --> 00:16:00.516 A:middle
but of course we
didn't stop there.

246
00:16:01.496 --> 00:16:03.706 A:middle
Text that has more
space between characters

247
00:16:03.706 --> 00:16:06.486 A:middle
at small sizes is
also more legible

248
00:16:07.086 --> 00:16:08.736 A:middle
so dynamic type does
that as well.

249
00:16:08.976 --> 00:16:12.676 A:middle
It dynamically adjusts, very
fine tune, sub-pixel level,

250
00:16:12.676 --> 00:16:14.026 A:middle
the space between characters

251
00:16:14.276 --> 00:16:16.446 A:middle
so no matter what size you
choose your text is going

252
00:16:16.446 --> 00:16:16.966 A:middle
to look great.

253
00:16:18.776 --> 00:16:20.146 A:middle
Now let's talk about styles.

254
00:16:20.776 --> 00:16:23.896 A:middle
In printed publishing,
typesetting, you know,

255
00:16:24.426 --> 00:16:28.206 A:middle
word processing we have these
categories for type like Body,

256
00:16:28.206 --> 00:16:31.186 A:middle
Headline, Caption,
and that helps you

257
00:16:31.186 --> 00:16:35.476 A:middle
to establish a clear information
hierarchy in your UI.

258
00:16:35.526 --> 00:16:37.156 A:middle
Some text is more
important than others

259
00:16:37.156 --> 00:16:38.466 A:middle
so it should be bigger
and heavier.

260
00:16:39.196 --> 00:16:41.026 A:middle
Some stuff less so right?

261
00:16:42.516 --> 00:16:43.796 A:middle
You guys are familiar
with this stuff.

262
00:16:43.796 --> 00:16:46.626 A:middle
You've seen it a million
times and this is a really,

263
00:16:46.766 --> 00:16:50.006 A:middle
really great system so we've
made that a fundamental part

264
00:16:50.006 --> 00:16:53.626 A:middle
of dynamic text-- type.

265
00:16:53.836 --> 00:16:55.736 A:middle
So this is the Inbox and all

266
00:16:55.736 --> 00:16:58.566 A:middle
of this was designed
using type styles.

267
00:16:59.346 --> 00:17:02.266 A:middle
The Inbox, the title for the
screen is the most important

268
00:17:02.266 --> 00:17:04.195 A:middle
thing here so you
know where you are,

269
00:17:04.195 --> 00:17:05.256 A:middle
you know what you're looking at.

270
00:17:05.656 --> 00:17:07.526 A:middle
Secondarily who sent it?

271
00:17:07.656 --> 00:17:10.036 A:middle
At this stage in time that's
the most important thing

272
00:17:10.036 --> 00:17:13.076 A:middle
that you need to know so
those use the heaviest styles.

273
00:17:14.986 --> 00:17:18.226 A:middle
It's really clean and
these styles allow you

274
00:17:18.226 --> 00:17:20.786 A:middle
to create relationships
between different types of text,

275
00:17:21.406 --> 00:17:24.236 A:middle
so you can see the intent
of how you're trying

276
00:17:24.236 --> 00:17:25.506 A:middle
to establish that hierarchy.

277
00:17:25.996 --> 00:17:29.836 A:middle
And of course these two
features work together.

278
00:17:31.896 --> 00:17:36.166 A:middle
Fine tune adjustments were made
to every one of these pieces

279
00:17:36.166 --> 00:17:41.756 A:middle
of text, every one of these
combinations of style and size.

280
00:17:41.986 --> 00:17:44.206 A:middle
So the other thing
that I want to point

281
00:17:44.206 --> 00:17:46.836 A:middle
out is there's line
height, which is the space

282
00:17:46.836 --> 00:17:48.596 A:middle
between lines of
text or leading.

283
00:17:49.866 --> 00:17:52.686 A:middle
And that adjusts too
so it's proportional.

284
00:17:53.126 --> 00:17:57.076 A:middle
So the composition of your
interface has great integrity no

285
00:17:57.076 --> 00:17:58.526 A:middle
matter what the text scale is.

286
00:17:58.686 --> 00:18:00.356 A:middle
These kinds of details
are really important

287
00:18:00.356 --> 00:18:02.636 A:middle
with visual design.

288
00:18:02.796 --> 00:18:06.766 A:middle
Now typography is
really complicated.

289
00:18:07.126 --> 00:18:09.466 A:middle
I've been a designer for
a while and I've worked

290
00:18:09.466 --> 00:18:12.826 A:middle
with some amazing designers
who can make great icons,

291
00:18:13.016 --> 00:18:15.476 A:middle
have a great sense of
composition and color,

292
00:18:15.476 --> 00:18:17.966 A:middle
good interaction designers

293
00:18:18.866 --> 00:18:21.086 A:middle
but I've seen people
struggle with typography.

294
00:18:21.186 --> 00:18:24.006 A:middle
It's something that a lot of us
as designers aren't trained for.

295
00:18:25.126 --> 00:18:26.136 A:middle
People go to school for this

296
00:18:26.136 --> 00:18:28.336 A:middle
for a really long
time and read books.

297
00:18:29.196 --> 00:18:30.436 A:middle
There's a lot of details here.

298
00:18:32.036 --> 00:18:35.716 A:middle
But luckily we have some really
good type designers at Apple

299
00:18:36.006 --> 00:18:40.166 A:middle
who have spent a lot of time
perfecting type in iOS 7.

300
00:18:40.656 --> 00:18:43.996 A:middle
So they've taken something
that's extremely hard to do well

301
00:18:44.276 --> 00:18:46.236 A:middle
and they made it really easy.

302
00:18:48.556 --> 00:18:50.196 A:middle
All right, let's move on.

303
00:18:50.196 --> 00:18:54.446 A:middle
So let's talk about
some of the differences

304
00:18:54.446 --> 00:18:56.866 A:middle
between iOS 7 and iOS 6 Mail.

305
00:18:57.426 --> 00:18:59.586 A:middle
Let's talk about bars.

306
00:19:00.156 --> 00:19:01.836 A:middle
Not the ones you
guys are going to go

307
00:19:01.836 --> 00:19:05.856 A:middle
to tonight but navigation bars.

308
00:19:07.216 --> 00:19:08.926 A:middle
Now obviously this has
changed quite a bit.

309
00:19:08.926 --> 00:19:12.116 A:middle
It's no longer this blue plastic
material that's convex in shape

310
00:19:12.486 --> 00:19:15.336 A:middle
and meant to portray some
sense of dimensionality.

311
00:19:15.786 --> 00:19:19.396 A:middle
It's now this solid white
color and it extends to the top

312
00:19:19.396 --> 00:19:22.326 A:middle
of the screen to work
really closely well,

313
00:19:22.326 --> 00:19:26.036 A:middle
work well with the status bar so
they work as one unified element

314
00:19:26.266 --> 00:19:27.276 A:middle
and it's still really clean.

315
00:19:27.276 --> 00:19:29.306 A:middle
It's easy to see everything
what's inside of it.

316
00:19:29.306 --> 00:19:32.016 A:middle
There's a lot of nice negative
space there, white space.

317
00:19:32.686 --> 00:19:35.926 A:middle
And the toolbar was designed
to match both of those

318
00:19:37.286 --> 00:19:39.356 A:middle
and as you can see it's
blurring the background content.

319
00:19:39.356 --> 00:19:40.716 A:middle
We saw that in the video before

320
00:19:41.016 --> 00:19:42.716 A:middle
so it's not completely
occluding,

321
00:19:42.836 --> 00:19:44.796 A:middle
clobbering the content behind.

322
00:19:45.706 --> 00:19:47.476 A:middle
As a result Mail
was more expansive.

323
00:19:47.476 --> 00:19:50.446 A:middle
It goes from edge to edge,
side to side, top to bottom

324
00:19:51.636 --> 00:19:54.666 A:middle
and the message, the
text and the picture,

325
00:19:55.276 --> 00:19:56.576 A:middle
it comes to the foreground more.

326
00:19:56.816 --> 00:19:59.656 A:middle
It's not stuck behind
these two blue bars

327
00:20:00.436 --> 00:20:03.376 A:middle
and that's what matters
most so we're deferring

328
00:20:03.376 --> 00:20:07.916 A:middle
to that through the UI.

329
00:20:08.116 --> 00:20:10.576 A:middle
Now we've removed the
borders around buttons

330
00:20:11.716 --> 00:20:15.876 A:middle
or bezels, as I might call them.

331
00:20:15.876 --> 00:20:16.676 A:middle
Why did we do that?

332
00:20:16.676 --> 00:20:17.876 A:middle
Well it's a really
simple reason.

333
00:20:18.096 --> 00:20:21.046 A:middle
When you get rid of that
ornamentation you have more room

334
00:20:21.046 --> 00:20:23.236 A:middle
to make text larger
and more legible.

335
00:20:24.126 --> 00:20:26.736 A:middle
Icons can be bigger and
they stand out more,

336
00:20:26.836 --> 00:20:28.816 A:middle
they're not competing
with the border themselves

337
00:20:28.816 --> 00:20:29.906 A:middle
for your attention.

338
00:20:30.476 --> 00:20:34.756 A:middle
The Back button, it remains
essentially unchanged.

339
00:20:35.186 --> 00:20:37.076 A:middle
It's still pointing to the
left side of the screen,

340
00:20:37.296 --> 00:20:39.516 A:middle
it's still the same height,
it still has the same label,

341
00:20:39.716 --> 00:20:41.016 A:middle
it's really easy to use.

342
00:20:41.216 --> 00:20:43.596 A:middle
You don't need the
border so it's gone.

343
00:20:47.376 --> 00:20:49.976 A:middle
Now words really matter
in interface design.

344
00:20:50.626 --> 00:20:53.726 A:middle
You have to answer the question
that your user is asking

345
00:20:54.146 --> 00:20:56.006 A:middle
in the way that they've
asked that question.

346
00:20:56.496 --> 00:20:59.676 A:middle
So, for example, this status
text, this isn't something

347
00:20:59.676 --> 00:21:02.136 A:middle
that we particularly innovated
but we improved upon it,

348
00:21:02.276 --> 00:21:03.116 A:middle
we can make it better.

349
00:21:03.926 --> 00:21:06.596 A:middle
The user is asking how
current is this content?

350
00:21:06.876 --> 00:21:07.976 A:middle
Rather than tell them the time

351
00:21:07.976 --> 00:21:10.496 A:middle
of day we tell them how
long ago this was updated.

352
00:21:10.496 --> 00:21:13.356 A:middle
So I want you guys to think
about that in your apps.

353
00:21:13.816 --> 00:21:15.006 A:middle
How are you phrasing things?

354
00:21:15.006 --> 00:21:15.976 A:middle
Are things technical?

355
00:21:16.836 --> 00:21:18.606 A:middle
Do people need to parse
them and interpret them?

356
00:21:18.876 --> 00:21:21.076 A:middle
Can you make it easier
for them to understand?

357
00:21:21.386 --> 00:21:22.806 A:middle
Can you speak with more clarity?

358
00:21:23.396 --> 00:21:26.766 A:middle
We heard about this
is Jony's video

359
00:21:26.836 --> 00:21:29.606 A:middle
but it was really important
to establish familiarity

360
00:21:29.606 --> 00:21:32.146 A:middle
and that was true for the
whole iOS and it's true

361
00:21:32.146 --> 00:21:33.346 A:middle
for every single
one of our apps.

362
00:21:33.346 --> 00:21:35.386 A:middle
So let's look at some
examples of that.

363
00:21:35.936 --> 00:21:38.716 A:middle
There's some really new,
powerful new features

364
00:21:38.716 --> 00:21:39.716 A:middle
that were added to Mail.

365
00:21:40.186 --> 00:21:43.256 A:middle
You can add smart searches
to quickly find mail

366
00:21:43.256 --> 00:21:47.166 A:middle
with attachments or flagged
messages, unread messages,

367
00:21:47.166 --> 00:21:50.426 A:middle
you can add links to
mailboxes you go to frequently.

368
00:21:50.946 --> 00:21:54.556 A:middle
That's powerful stuff but it was
added in a way that was logical,

369
00:21:54.556 --> 00:21:57.396 A:middle
it was an extension of what
people already knew before

370
00:21:57.396 --> 00:22:00.526 A:middle
which is to go into this Edit
mode, so it's really seamless.

371
00:22:00.836 --> 00:22:02.086 A:middle
Think about that with your apps.

372
00:22:02.336 --> 00:22:06.066 A:middle
You make an app, you release
it, people get to know how

373
00:22:06.066 --> 00:22:08.646 A:middle
to use it, they get
accustomed to certain things,

374
00:22:08.866 --> 00:22:11.146 A:middle
location of controls
and nomenclature,

375
00:22:11.746 --> 00:22:14.026 A:middle
and then you do an update and
you add some new features.

376
00:22:14.756 --> 00:22:18.126 A:middle
You don't want to completely
move things around on them.

377
00:22:18.446 --> 00:22:20.946 A:middle
That makes people
confused, frustrated,

378
00:22:22.356 --> 00:22:24.746 A:middle
it's not a good thing.

379
00:22:24.966 --> 00:22:26.836 A:middle
Another great example
of that is Action Sheet.

380
00:22:27.606 --> 00:22:29.126 A:middle
So this is visually different.

381
00:22:29.126 --> 00:22:31.636 A:middle
You can see we removed the
borders around buttons here too

382
00:22:32.326 --> 00:22:35.126 A:middle
and as a result it's much more
compact and you can see more

383
00:22:35.126 --> 00:22:36.196 A:middle
of the message still even

384
00:22:36.196 --> 00:22:38.266 A:middle
when the Action Sheet is
up, which is important.

385
00:22:38.446 --> 00:22:40.336 A:middle
It's important to know
what you're acting upon.

386
00:22:40.676 --> 00:22:42.636 A:middle
But a lot has remained the same.

387
00:22:42.856 --> 00:22:45.586 A:middle
The order that these are
in, the labels that we used,

388
00:22:45.696 --> 00:22:48.496 A:middle
red still warns you about
potentially harmful actions,

389
00:22:48.786 --> 00:22:51.056 A:middle
the safest button is at the
bottom and it's separated

390
00:22:51.056 --> 00:22:53.516 A:middle
out from the rest and it's
the easiest to access.

391
00:22:53.786 --> 00:22:57.126 A:middle
It's a lot of important stuff
that's remained exactly the same

392
00:22:57.126 --> 00:22:58.436 A:middle
so it's instantly familiar.

393
00:23:02.816 --> 00:23:04.116 A:middle
Let's move onto Calendar.

394
00:23:04.736 --> 00:23:07.766 A:middle
So as you can see, Calendar
has changed as well.

395
00:23:07.766 --> 00:23:10.226 A:middle
It's adopted a lot of the
same design language as Mail

396
00:23:10.226 --> 00:23:12.766 A:middle
so it's now open
and less fragmented,

397
00:23:12.846 --> 00:23:16.146 A:middle
but that's not what
I want to talk about.

398
00:23:16.216 --> 00:23:19.736 A:middle
I want to talk about that, that
segmented control right there.

399
00:23:19.736 --> 00:23:22.026 A:middle
I'm going to spend a little
bit of time with this.

400
00:23:22.976 --> 00:23:25.206 A:middle
In particular, I'm going
to start with the Day

401
00:23:25.476 --> 00:23:27.966 A:middle
and Month buttons in
the segmented control.

402
00:23:29.226 --> 00:23:31.706 A:middle
Now as we know there's a
hierarchal relationship

403
00:23:32.036 --> 00:23:33.526 A:middle
between days and months.

404
00:23:34.016 --> 00:23:36.286 A:middle
We all have that
deeply engrained in us,

405
00:23:36.706 --> 00:23:40.156 A:middle
seconds are in minutes
are in hours are in days,

406
00:23:40.336 --> 00:23:42.786 A:middle
I hope I get this right, are
in weeks are in months are

407
00:23:42.786 --> 00:23:44.676 A:middle
in years are in decades,
centuries.

408
00:23:45.976 --> 00:23:48.806 A:middle
It's really important that
the information hierarchy

409
00:23:49.546 --> 00:23:54.126 A:middle
of the data inside of your app
is respected by the interface.

410
00:23:54.296 --> 00:23:56.666 A:middle
The interface is a
natural fit for that.

411
00:23:57.206 --> 00:23:59.116 A:middle
I'll explain more
about what I mean.

412
00:24:01.336 --> 00:24:05.246 A:middle
So this is the Month view and
as you can see if I want to get

413
00:24:05.246 --> 00:24:09.606 A:middle
to today I don't have the button
there in the bottom to press,

414
00:24:09.846 --> 00:24:10.736 A:middle
so how do I get there?

415
00:24:11.176 --> 00:24:13.176 A:middle
Well, I simply press the 12.

416
00:24:13.746 --> 00:24:17.076 A:middle
Now before I do that I want
to have you guys pay attention

417
00:24:17.076 --> 00:24:18.926 A:middle
to where that red dot goes.

418
00:24:19.496 --> 00:24:23.526 A:middle
See how it just splits open?

419
00:24:23.936 --> 00:24:26.986 A:middle
That animation reinforces
that feeling that you've dove

420
00:24:27.156 --> 00:24:31.496 A:middle
into that day and the week stays
around at the top so you can use

421
00:24:31.496 --> 00:24:33.856 A:middle
that as a control,
which is really elegant.

422
00:24:35.316 --> 00:24:39.046 A:middle
And we conceptualize hierarchy
visually from top to bottom,

423
00:24:39.146 --> 00:24:41.066 A:middle
right, that's the way we
typically think about it.

424
00:24:42.036 --> 00:24:43.166 A:middle
Look at the order of things.

425
00:24:43.386 --> 00:24:46.486 A:middle
The Back button shows you the
month, the week below that,

426
00:24:46.746 --> 00:24:49.656 A:middle
the current day below that
and then the hours below that.

427
00:24:50.536 --> 00:24:54.306 A:middle
It's perfectly complementing
our mental model of hierarchy.

428
00:24:55.056 --> 00:24:56.436 A:middle
So it's a really nice design.

429
00:24:57.856 --> 00:25:00.446 A:middle
Now I also want to
talk about animation

430
00:25:00.446 --> 00:25:01.766 A:middle
and moving across days.

431
00:25:02.276 --> 00:25:05.196 A:middle
So this day picker, or this
week view, sticks around.

432
00:25:05.786 --> 00:25:09.576 A:middle
So if I want to see what
I did on Monday we get

433
00:25:09.576 --> 00:25:10.736 A:middle
that lateral animation.

434
00:25:10.736 --> 00:25:12.526 A:middle
It gives us a really
nice intuitive sense

435
00:25:12.526 --> 00:25:13.586 A:middle
of movement through time.

436
00:25:14.366 --> 00:25:17.756 A:middle
And if we go to Friday,
again, it just goes

437
00:25:17.756 --> 00:25:18.956 A:middle
in the opposite direction.

438
00:25:20.156 --> 00:25:22.396 A:middle
So we always have our context.

439
00:25:22.396 --> 00:25:23.856 A:middle
It really feels solid.

440
00:25:24.176 --> 00:25:25.946 A:middle
We're oriented inside
the application

441
00:25:25.946 --> 00:25:26.956 A:middle
and that's really important.

442
00:25:27.326 --> 00:25:30.576 A:middle
The opposite of feeling in
context is feeling lost.

443
00:25:31.676 --> 00:25:34.136 A:middle
It's really easy to get
lost in someone's interface.

444
00:25:37.516 --> 00:25:41.486 A:middle
So, oops, went too fast.

445
00:25:42.286 --> 00:25:44.906 A:middle
So in iOS 6 and before
there was this swipe.

446
00:25:44.906 --> 00:25:47.076 A:middle
You would swipe anywhere
on the Calendar, to move -

447
00:25:47.436 --> 00:25:49.126 A:middle
to move to the next
day or the previous day

448
00:25:50.276 --> 00:25:52.906 A:middle
and so we extended
that to the week.

449
00:25:53.086 --> 00:25:53.926 A:middle
It's really natural.

450
00:25:54.086 --> 00:25:55.216 A:middle
It's really powerful.

451
00:25:55.456 --> 00:25:57.676 A:middle
So now I can also
animate to the next week

452
00:25:57.676 --> 00:25:58.656 A:middle
to see what's going on there.

453
00:25:58.656 --> 00:26:04.696 A:middle
So the next thing I want to
talk about with animation is

454
00:26:04.696 --> 00:26:07.956 A:middle
that making really
good animations is kind

455
00:26:07.956 --> 00:26:08.746 A:middle
of a tricky thing.

456
00:26:08.746 --> 00:26:11.296 A:middle
It's really delicate yet
there's a lot of subtlety to it.

457
00:26:11.296 --> 00:26:13.876 A:middle
You're trying to reproduce
the feeling of real life.

458
00:26:14.396 --> 00:26:18.566 A:middle
So the next thing we'll do is go
back, step back through the days

459
00:26:18.566 --> 00:26:20.586 A:middle
of this week and I want
you to pay attention

460
00:26:20.586 --> 00:26:21.816 A:middle
to how the animation works.

461
00:26:22.176 --> 00:26:24.066 A:middle
You don't just go from
point A to point B.

462
00:26:24.066 --> 00:26:28.276 A:middle
You go to point A to point B
and you overshoot and come back.

463
00:26:28.756 --> 00:26:29.966 A:middle
Let's look at that.

464
00:26:31.516 --> 00:26:33.346 A:middle
See that little bounce?

465
00:26:34.196 --> 00:26:37.356 A:middle
That bounce adds a sense
of physical realism.

466
00:26:38.316 --> 00:26:39.716 A:middle
We get this kind
of intuitive sense

467
00:26:39.716 --> 00:26:41.206 A:middle
of how the mechanics
of this work.

468
00:26:41.206 --> 00:26:45.486 A:middle
And that imparts a
sense of liveliness.

469
00:26:46.796 --> 00:26:49.736 A:middle
Not through the visual design
but through how things respond

470
00:26:49.806 --> 00:26:51.306 A:middle
to our touch interactions.

471
00:26:52.136 --> 00:26:55.106 A:middle
And this kind of stuff you
can do with UI dynamics.

472
00:26:55.966 --> 00:26:59.156 A:middle
That physics engine that
we've built in, you can apply

473
00:26:59.156 --> 00:27:02.466 A:middle
that to your apps to make them
feel more deeply lifelike.

474
00:27:03.686 --> 00:27:07.356 A:middle
It's great stuff.

475
00:27:08.786 --> 00:27:10.986 A:middle
So now we want to get
back to the Month field

476
00:27:11.036 --> 00:27:11.786 A:middle
and how do we do that?

477
00:27:11.786 --> 00:27:13.076 A:middle
Well we press the Back button

478
00:27:13.916 --> 00:27:17.286 A:middle
and as you just saw the
animation is the opposite

479
00:27:17.316 --> 00:27:20.016 A:middle
of what we saw before
when we went into the Day.

480
00:27:20.056 --> 00:27:22.486 A:middle
And that's really
important too with animation.

481
00:27:22.946 --> 00:27:25.116 A:middle
You want to make sure that your
animations are symmetrical.

482
00:27:25.346 --> 00:27:27.906 A:middle
I've seen tons of apps
where getting from point A

483
00:27:27.906 --> 00:27:30.116 A:middle
to point B there's
one type of animation

484
00:27:30.346 --> 00:27:32.716 A:middle
but coming back again it's a
different type of animation

485
00:27:32.936 --> 00:27:36.616 A:middle
or there's no animation at
all, and that's deeply bizarre.

486
00:27:37.456 --> 00:27:39.536 A:middle
You want to make sure you
have symmetry in animation.

487
00:27:40.106 --> 00:27:43.076 A:middle
Now the great thing
about this new design is

488
00:27:43.076 --> 00:27:44.006 A:middle
that it's scalable.

489
00:27:44.636 --> 00:27:46.976 A:middle
So now we can do something
we couldn't do before using

490
00:27:46.976 --> 00:27:48.756 A:middle
that segmented control.

491
00:27:49.516 --> 00:27:50.966 A:middle
We can go back up to the Year.

492
00:27:51.566 --> 00:27:53.456 A:middle
Let's watch as that
animation happens

493
00:27:53.456 --> 00:27:55.226 A:middle
because this is really keen.

494
00:27:55.776 --> 00:27:59.276 A:middle
The whole screen shrinks down
to where the Month is now.

495
00:27:59.826 --> 00:28:03.896 A:middle
Your eye follows it so there's
no doubt where, how you get back

496
00:28:03.896 --> 00:28:04.996 A:middle
to where you were before.

497
00:28:05.466 --> 00:28:07.956 A:middle
You feel in context the
hierarchy is really clear

498
00:28:07.956 --> 00:28:09.296 A:middle
through that zoom out animation.

499
00:28:09.296 --> 00:28:13.296 A:middle
And what's really awesome about
this is that that same approach

500
00:28:13.296 --> 00:28:16.856 A:middle
to animation applies to
when we exit Calendar

501
00:28:16.856 --> 00:28:18.156 A:middle
and go back to the Home screen.

502
00:28:18.276 --> 00:28:19.226 A:middle
So let's do that now.

503
00:28:21.296 --> 00:28:24.076 A:middle
The Year shrinks
down to the app icon.

504
00:28:24.256 --> 00:28:26.516 A:middle
If you accidentally press
the Home button and you want

505
00:28:26.516 --> 00:28:28.996 A:middle
to quickly go back to
Calendar, it's really easy to do

506
00:28:28.996 --> 00:28:31.916 A:middle
that because your eye
tracked to the app icon.

507
00:28:33.366 --> 00:28:36.616 A:middle
That kind of rigor,
systematic application

508
00:28:36.616 --> 00:28:40.636 A:middle
of animation throughout the
platform, throughout iOS 7,

509
00:28:41.366 --> 00:28:44.236 A:middle
is really important and I think
there's something to take away

510
00:28:44.236 --> 00:28:45.766 A:middle
from that with your apps.

511
00:28:45.766 --> 00:28:46.856 A:middle
You want to be consistent.

512
00:28:47.356 --> 00:28:48.466 A:middle
You want to be rigorous.

513
00:28:49.026 --> 00:28:51.346 A:middle
It leads to a really
cohesive user experience

514
00:28:51.346 --> 00:28:52.376 A:middle
and it's really important

515
00:28:52.406 --> 00:28:54.886 A:middle
to have your app stand
out from the rest.

516
00:28:55.806 --> 00:28:57.386 A:middle
Let's watch as we dive back in

517
00:28:57.386 --> 00:28:58.576 A:middle
and just see it all
come together.

518
00:29:02.916 --> 00:29:05.716 A:middle
[Silence] It's really
fluid, really natural.

519
00:29:07.156 --> 00:29:11.426 A:middle
All right, now Greg
talked about clarity.

520
00:29:11.426 --> 00:29:14.296 A:middle
A big part of that is starting
with functionality and thinking

521
00:29:14.296 --> 00:29:15.956 A:middle
about how to design
your application

522
00:29:15.956 --> 00:29:18.216 A:middle
so it's a pure expression
of that functionality.

523
00:29:18.626 --> 00:29:21.416 A:middle
You pick up the phone,
you look at the app

524
00:29:21.416 --> 00:29:24.716 A:middle
and you immediately know what
this is capable of doing,

525
00:29:25.036 --> 00:29:28.086 A:middle
what this is for and how
you're supposed to use it.

526
00:29:28.776 --> 00:29:32.186 A:middle
This is a theme you're going
to see in a lot of these apps.

527
00:29:32.906 --> 00:29:35.206 A:middle
So this was the third button
in that segmented control.

528
00:29:35.206 --> 00:29:36.546 A:middle
This is the List view.

529
00:29:36.546 --> 00:29:38.596 A:middle
Now the List view
is kind of useful

530
00:29:38.596 --> 00:29:41.606 A:middle
but what was really powerful
about the List view is

531
00:29:41.606 --> 00:29:42.526 A:middle
that you could search it.

532
00:29:43.236 --> 00:29:46.826 A:middle
Searching is really useful
but you wouldn't know

533
00:29:46.826 --> 00:29:48.136 A:middle
that by the fact
that it was stuck

534
00:29:48.136 --> 00:29:49.836 A:middle
in the List view
unless you lived

535
00:29:49.836 --> 00:29:52.906 A:middle
in the List view all the time,
you would be missing the fact

536
00:29:52.906 --> 00:29:54.346 A:middle
that you could search Calendar.

537
00:29:55.626 --> 00:29:58.816 A:middle
So to rectify that Search was
put at the top right corner

538
00:29:59.026 --> 00:30:01.046 A:middle
so it's immediately
available at any point

539
00:30:01.586 --> 00:30:02.536 A:middle
when you're using Calendar.

540
00:30:03.106 --> 00:30:04.676 A:middle
And you can apply
that too to your app.

541
00:30:04.676 --> 00:30:07.006 A:middle
I mean what's the really
important functionality

542
00:30:07.006 --> 00:30:07.506 A:middle
in your app?

543
00:30:07.506 --> 00:30:09.396 A:middle
Is it placed in the
right location?

544
00:30:09.396 --> 00:30:10.446 A:middle
Is it understandable?

545
00:30:10.446 --> 00:30:12.146 A:middle
Can people find it?

546
00:30:13.456 --> 00:30:15.816 A:middle
Now getting rid of clutter
is a big part of that.

547
00:30:16.186 --> 00:30:18.736 A:middle
If there's less things competing
for someone's attention,

548
00:30:18.996 --> 00:30:20.636 A:middle
they're more likely
to see what matters.

549
00:30:21.056 --> 00:30:25.716 A:middle
Now we can search,
we can see the list,

550
00:30:26.636 --> 00:30:28.086 A:middle
it's really straight forward.

551
00:30:30.456 --> 00:30:32.756 A:middle
So while we're talking
about Search,

552
00:30:32.956 --> 00:30:34.506 A:middle
let's spend a second
with these two icons.

553
00:30:35.046 --> 00:30:36.716 A:middle
I'm going to give
you some free advice.

554
00:30:37.736 --> 00:30:40.116 A:middle
Okay, it's going
to cost you $1,600

555
00:30:40.356 --> 00:30:42.766 A:middle
but I think it's
totally worth it.

556
00:30:44.376 --> 00:30:46.556 A:middle
These icons work
really, really well.

557
00:30:46.816 --> 00:30:49.686 A:middle
You guys all know, I don't
know all of you but I know

558
00:30:50.156 --> 00:30:53.146 A:middle
that you know what these mean,
Search and Add something,

559
00:30:53.146 --> 00:30:54.706 A:middle
whatever that is,
depends on the context

560
00:30:54.706 --> 00:30:56.936 A:middle
of the application you're
in, but it totally works.

561
00:30:57.236 --> 00:31:00.446 A:middle
And it works because you've
seen these icons a million times

562
00:31:00.976 --> 00:31:04.346 A:middle
and every time you've pressed
one of those icons it responded

563
00:31:04.346 --> 00:31:05.856 A:middle
in a really consistent way.

564
00:31:05.986 --> 00:31:07.026 A:middle
It allowed you to search.

565
00:31:07.026 --> 00:31:08.136 A:middle
It allowed you to add whatever.

566
00:31:09.806 --> 00:31:12.666 A:middle
Most icons don't fall
into that category.

567
00:31:13.376 --> 00:31:16.766 A:middle
Now I've made who knows
how many icons in my time.

568
00:31:17.336 --> 00:31:19.456 A:middle
More than I care to
even think about.

569
00:31:20.656 --> 00:31:22.726 A:middle
And I think I'm pretty
decent at making them

570
00:31:22.956 --> 00:31:26.406 A:middle
but I can't tell you how
many times I've made an icon

571
00:31:26.406 --> 00:31:27.976 A:middle
and I thought I did a
really good job with it

572
00:31:28.216 --> 00:31:29.546 A:middle
and then I showed it to someone

573
00:31:30.016 --> 00:31:31.586 A:middle
and they didn't know
what it meant.

574
00:31:31.586 --> 00:31:33.696 A:middle
It wasn't clear.

575
00:31:34.146 --> 00:31:35.996 A:middle
They guessed but
they guessed wrong.

576
00:31:37.106 --> 00:31:41.136 A:middle
And I suspect that it might be
the same with some of your apps.

577
00:31:42.216 --> 00:31:45.376 A:middle
If you have icons in your
apps, you'll look at them

578
00:31:45.376 --> 00:31:47.306 A:middle
and you'll know exactly
what they do,

579
00:31:47.306 --> 00:31:51.136 A:middle
exactly what they represent,
but it's important to show them

580
00:31:51.136 --> 00:31:55.196 A:middle
to someone else who's never used
your app before and ask them,

581
00:31:56.056 --> 00:31:57.586 A:middle
tell them to tell you,
"What does this mean?"

582
00:31:57.696 --> 00:31:58.316 A:middle
What does this do?

583
00:31:58.856 --> 00:32:01.226 A:middle
You might be really surprised
to find the answers you get.

584
00:32:02.086 --> 00:32:05.256 A:middle
It's often more clear
to use text.

585
00:32:06.076 --> 00:32:08.846 A:middle
So for example this is
the Inbox icon that we had

586
00:32:08.976 --> 00:32:10.326 A:middle
in the previous version
of Calendar.

587
00:32:11.246 --> 00:32:13.226 A:middle
Sorry, I see people
craning their neck.

588
00:32:13.226 --> 00:32:15.786 A:middle
It's a little tray with
an arrow pointing to it.

589
00:32:17.036 --> 00:32:18.626 A:middle
Now this actually
is a good icon.

590
00:32:18.866 --> 00:32:20.036 A:middle
There's nothing wrong with it.

591
00:32:20.036 --> 00:32:23.366 A:middle
It sort of extends
the Mail Inbox model,

592
00:32:23.366 --> 00:32:25.686 A:middle
we've always had
this tray for that.

593
00:32:26.236 --> 00:32:30.866 A:middle
But we have more space with
iOS 7 so it was much more clear

594
00:32:30.866 --> 00:32:33.376 A:middle
to present this command as text.

595
00:32:33.556 --> 00:32:34.846 A:middle
There's no ambiguity there.

596
00:32:35.036 --> 00:32:39.446 A:middle
Sorry, for those that can't
see it, it says Inbox in text.

597
00:32:40.226 --> 00:32:44.676 A:middle
And also just another thing,
in a bar like this it's better

598
00:32:44.676 --> 00:32:47.626 A:middle
to just have all
text or all icons.

599
00:32:47.876 --> 00:32:50.346 A:middle
If you mix the two it can
get kind of confusing.

600
00:32:50.846 --> 00:32:53.116 A:middle
All right, Notes.

601
00:32:53.296 --> 00:32:59.846 A:middle
I want to talk about
realism for a second.

602
00:32:59.906 --> 00:33:02.166 A:middle
This was Notes.

603
00:33:02.766 --> 00:33:05.106 A:middle
This was Notes from iOS 6

604
00:33:05.106 --> 00:33:07.706 A:middle
and actually all the way
back to the first phone.

605
00:33:09.006 --> 00:33:13.116 A:middle
And it had this really clear
notepad motif, this theme.

606
00:33:13.116 --> 00:33:14.646 A:middle
It looked like a
legal pad of paper.

607
00:33:15.476 --> 00:33:18.836 A:middle
And the team that made this
did a really good job of it.

608
00:33:18.926 --> 00:33:21.636 A:middle
It was a great attention
to detail, the textures,

609
00:33:21.666 --> 00:33:25.896 A:middle
the torn paper edges, the way
the lines there move slightly

610
00:33:25.896 --> 00:33:28.136 A:middle
over to the left to
convey the sense of depth,

611
00:33:28.776 --> 00:33:31.346 A:middle
the typeface that's legible,
the handwritten font,

612
00:33:32.056 --> 00:33:35.226 A:middle
the icons that were custom
designed to match the style

613
00:33:35.226 --> 00:33:38.806 A:middle
of the notepad and the way
the page curled as you went

614
00:33:38.906 --> 00:33:42.606 A:middle
from the next to the previous
note or went through notes,

615
00:33:43.516 --> 00:33:46.446 A:middle
really sold the idea that
this was a legal pad.

616
00:33:47.936 --> 00:33:50.536 A:middle
But why? Why do this?

617
00:33:51.646 --> 00:33:56.256 A:middle
Well to explain that we
have to go back to 2007.

618
00:33:56.256 --> 00:33:57.986 A:middle
We're going to take
a trip back in time.

619
00:33:58.426 --> 00:34:00.866 A:middle
It's 2007, there is no iPhone,

620
00:34:01.056 --> 00:34:02.546 A:middle
you don't know what
multi-touch means,

621
00:34:02.936 --> 00:34:05.336 A:middle
you've never used
a device like this.

622
00:34:05.756 --> 00:34:08.386 A:middle
You haven't heard about swipe,
you haven't heard about pinch,

623
00:34:08.386 --> 00:34:11.266 A:middle
you haven't heard about rotate,
that's not in your lexicon,

624
00:34:11.536 --> 00:34:14.376 A:middle
it's not in your vocabulary,
you don't use those terms.

625
00:34:15.876 --> 00:34:18.906 A:middle
So when these apps were being
designed it was really important

626
00:34:18.906 --> 00:34:22.815 A:middle
that to make it easy,
to pick one of these up

627
00:34:22.815 --> 00:34:26.065 A:middle
and be successful with it,
accomplish tasks that you want

628
00:34:26.065 --> 00:34:28.716 A:middle
to accomplish, that it should
be immediately familiar.

629
00:34:29.766 --> 00:34:33.456 A:middle
So real world objects were used
as the basis for the app UI

630
00:34:33.545 --> 00:34:35.585 A:middle
in a lot of the apps
that we saw.

631
00:34:36.596 --> 00:34:38.896 A:middle
A legal pad is so ordinary.

632
00:34:39.166 --> 00:34:40.416 A:middle
Everyone knows what it's for.

633
00:34:40.416 --> 00:34:42.246 A:middle
Everyone knows how to use it.

634
00:34:44.396 --> 00:34:48.666 A:middle
But sometimes when you use a
real world metaphor as the basis

635
00:34:48.815 --> 00:34:51.136 A:middle
for your UI it doesn't
really scale.

636
00:34:52.485 --> 00:34:56.076 A:middle
So for example, you
can't search a notepad.

637
00:34:57.085 --> 00:35:00.066 A:middle
So when you add that it
starts to ruin the illusion.

638
00:35:00.676 --> 00:35:01.886 A:middle
Things start to breakdown.

639
00:35:02.526 --> 00:35:05.726 A:middle
So this is the new
design for Notes.

640
00:35:07.526 --> 00:35:09.946 A:middle
It's so much more clear
what's important here.

641
00:35:10.326 --> 00:35:11.786 A:middle
It's the content of your notes.

642
00:35:12.236 --> 00:35:13.416 A:middle
That's front and center.

643
00:35:13.416 --> 00:35:15.956 A:middle
It's not about the
style of the app.

644
00:35:15.956 --> 00:35:19.696 A:middle
It's not about showing you how
great you can represent a legal

645
00:35:19.696 --> 00:35:20.456 A:middle
pad of paper.

646
00:35:20.676 --> 00:35:23.926 A:middle
It's about what matters,
the Notes.

647
00:35:24.876 --> 00:35:28.556 A:middle
But you can still see that it's
been stylized, it has a theme

648
00:35:28.556 --> 00:35:30.936 A:middle
but that theme serves a
very different purpose now.

649
00:35:31.436 --> 00:35:34.876 A:middle
It's meant to impart warmth
and personality and character.

650
00:35:35.946 --> 00:35:38.476 A:middle
And great detail went into
making this just right.

651
00:35:38.476 --> 00:35:40.706 A:middle
We have this letterpress
text effect

652
00:35:41.866 --> 00:35:44.196 A:middle
and the paper texture
is really realistic.

653
00:35:44.796 --> 00:35:47.696 A:middle
You can see that
when you zoom in.

654
00:35:47.826 --> 00:35:51.956 A:middle
Now let's talk about clutter.

655
00:35:51.956 --> 00:35:57.596 A:middle
As you'll see there's
a difference here

656
00:35:57.716 --> 00:35:58.956 A:middle
between these two versions.

657
00:35:58.956 --> 00:36:02.486 A:middle
There's something missing in
iOS 7 and that's the title.

658
00:36:03.326 --> 00:36:06.066 A:middle
Now we've always advised
have a title for your screen,

659
00:36:06.066 --> 00:36:07.686 A:middle
have a title for your
screen, it's really important

660
00:36:07.906 --> 00:36:10.746 A:middle
and 99 percent of the time
it is really important

661
00:36:11.086 --> 00:36:13.746 A:middle
so don't just go remove your
titles with reckless abandon.

662
00:36:14.336 --> 00:36:19.826 A:middle
The title tells you where you
are and what you are looking at,

663
00:36:20.856 --> 00:36:22.696 A:middle
but did it matter here?

664
00:36:23.296 --> 00:36:25.086 A:middle
Notes is such a simple
application.

665
00:36:25.416 --> 00:36:27.756 A:middle
The name of the application
is its title.

666
00:36:27.986 --> 00:36:29.926 A:middle
It tells you what you're
going to be looking at here.

667
00:36:30.196 --> 00:36:31.336 A:middle
There's no ambiguity.

668
00:36:31.336 --> 00:36:32.096 A:middle
You don't know.

669
00:36:32.096 --> 00:36:34.906 A:middle
Those aren't emails
or something else.

670
00:36:35.296 --> 00:36:35.816 A:middle
These are notes.

671
00:36:36.496 --> 00:36:39.206 A:middle
So there is no point in
showing the title so we didn't.

672
00:36:41.596 --> 00:36:43.956 A:middle
Same is true when you're
looking at an individual note.

673
00:36:44.246 --> 00:36:46.476 A:middle
Previously it was just generated
by the first line of text

674
00:36:46.476 --> 00:36:47.946 A:middle
so it was always
totally redundant.

675
00:36:48.456 --> 00:36:49.646 A:middle
What's the point of doing that?

676
00:36:50.326 --> 00:36:52.316 A:middle
There is none so the
title is removed.

677
00:36:52.956 --> 00:36:56.026 A:middle
And one last thing
about Notes is color.

678
00:36:56.806 --> 00:37:00.286 A:middle
Now you'll see that the color,
you'll see this yellow color

679
00:37:00.286 --> 00:37:02.946 A:middle
in Notes and that's the tint
color of the application.

680
00:37:03.656 --> 00:37:05.256 A:middle
That color serves
two purposes here.

681
00:37:05.526 --> 00:37:08.736 A:middle
One, it indicates things that
are interactive and two it helps

682
00:37:08.796 --> 00:37:10.946 A:middle
to stylize the look and
appearance of your app.

683
00:37:12.006 --> 00:37:14.976 A:middle
Now you'll want to pick a
tint color for your iOS 7 app

684
00:37:14.976 --> 00:37:17.186 A:middle
and you'll probably pick
something that works well

685
00:37:17.186 --> 00:37:19.006 A:middle
with your brand or
your app icon.

686
00:37:19.006 --> 00:37:22.556 A:middle
So if your logo has green
color, make a green tint.

687
00:37:23.236 --> 00:37:24.886 A:middle
You know any color is
going to work well.

688
00:37:25.576 --> 00:37:31.266 A:middle
You can use purple, red,
yellow, orange, green, blue,

689
00:37:31.346 --> 00:37:35.186 A:middle
everything expect for
white, I don't know.

690
00:37:36.696 --> 00:37:37.676 A:middle
Let's move onto Safari.

691
00:37:38.796 --> 00:37:41.246 A:middle
So with Safari I want to
talk about iconography.

692
00:37:41.976 --> 00:37:45.036 A:middle
Now as you saw we've
redesigned all of our icons.

693
00:37:45.036 --> 00:37:50.896 A:middle
So these five icons they look
visually different and that's

694
00:37:51.076 --> 00:37:55.416 A:middle
because they're five
of a huge set of icons

695
00:37:55.416 --> 00:37:58.966 A:middle
that were fully redesigned for
iOS 7 and they were redesigned

696
00:37:58.966 --> 00:38:00.576 A:middle
so that they matched each other.

697
00:38:01.886 --> 00:38:04.196 A:middle
They're straightforward,
front on,

698
00:38:04.416 --> 00:38:07.566 A:middle
they have thin delicate
line features, the curvature

699
00:38:07.646 --> 00:38:09.656 A:middle
of the shapes is
really consistent.

700
00:38:10.006 --> 00:38:11.616 A:middle
A lot of care and thought went

701
00:38:11.616 --> 00:38:14.066 A:middle
into making this
system hang together.

702
00:38:14.886 --> 00:38:18.206 A:middle
Now I know a lot of you guys
don't make a couple dozen apps

703
00:38:18.206 --> 00:38:19.566 A:middle
and whole operating system,

704
00:38:20.206 --> 00:38:24.256 A:middle
but even if in your app you
only have two icons you have

705
00:38:24.316 --> 00:38:26.376 A:middle
to make sure that they
work well together.

706
00:38:26.916 --> 00:38:30.276 A:middle
I can't tell you how many apps
I've seen in my experience

707
00:38:30.276 --> 00:38:33.166 A:middle
where icons just look
like they were pulled

708
00:38:33.166 --> 00:38:35.516 A:middle
from different sources or
made by different designers.

709
00:38:36.446 --> 00:38:39.096 A:middle
And the problem with that is it
makes your app look cluttered

710
00:38:40.206 --> 00:38:43.836 A:middle
and incoherent and we're
really sensitive to that.

711
00:38:43.836 --> 00:38:47.546 A:middle
We have a really high bar
for that kind of consistency.

712
00:38:48.406 --> 00:38:50.886 A:middle
We've seen a lot of great
software in our time, all of us,

713
00:38:51.206 --> 00:38:56.966 A:middle
and so when we look at every app
we measure them against that.

714
00:38:57.176 --> 00:39:02.206 A:middle
Now it wasn't sufficient to just
make icons match each other,

715
00:39:03.156 --> 00:39:06.316 A:middle
they also match the
clean, crisp typeface

716
00:39:06.366 --> 00:39:07.906 A:middle
that we use as a system font.

717
00:39:09.166 --> 00:39:10.126 A:middle
That's also really important.

718
00:39:10.126 --> 00:39:13.806 A:middle
We wanted to establish an
overall aesthetic for iOS 7

719
00:39:13.806 --> 00:39:15.546 A:middle
that really hung together well.

720
00:39:16.886 --> 00:39:20.066 A:middle
That also can apply, you know
let's say you're making an app

721
00:39:20.066 --> 00:39:23.426 A:middle
about the U.S. Constitution, you
don't want to use marker felt

722
00:39:23.866 --> 00:39:26.366 A:middle
with the parchment texture,
that would look really corny.

723
00:39:26.946 --> 00:39:28.696 A:middle
You want to pick a font
that's appropriate.

724
00:39:30.436 --> 00:39:33.156 A:middle
But although the style of
these icons has changed

725
00:39:33.946 --> 00:39:35.356 A:middle
so much has remained the same.

726
00:39:35.966 --> 00:39:40.026 A:middle
The symbology of the icons
is identical, arrows for back

727
00:39:40.026 --> 00:39:42.596 A:middle
and forward, open
book for bookmarks,

728
00:39:43.066 --> 00:39:46.036 A:middle
the order that they're in and
the location on the screen,

729
00:39:46.276 --> 00:39:47.486 A:middle
they've all stayed the same

730
00:39:47.486 --> 00:39:49.806 A:middle
so your muscle memory still
will serve you really well,

731
00:39:50.146 --> 00:39:51.336 A:middle
it's really familiar.

732
00:39:51.906 --> 00:39:54.196 A:middle
Let's move onto Weather.

733
00:39:54.196 --> 00:39:57.616 A:middle
I want to talk about affordance.

734
00:39:58.346 --> 00:40:03.116 A:middle
Now this is a $5 word and I know
a lot of you know what it means

735
00:40:04.036 --> 00:40:05.966 A:middle
but I've heard different
definitions and for anyone

736
00:40:05.966 --> 00:40:08.206 A:middle
who doesn't know what it
means, let me define it just

737
00:40:08.206 --> 00:40:11.536 A:middle
so we all share a
common meaning for this.

738
00:40:12.306 --> 00:40:14.306 A:middle
So take a door for example.

739
00:40:14.376 --> 00:40:15.686 A:middle
If it has a handle on it,

740
00:40:16.016 --> 00:40:17.996 A:middle
it affords you the
ability to pull it.

741
00:40:18.706 --> 00:40:20.006 A:middle
If it doesn't have
a handle on it,

742
00:40:20.006 --> 00:40:21.706 A:middle
it affords you the
ability to push it.

743
00:40:22.306 --> 00:40:24.806 A:middle
All physical objects
have this quality.

744
00:40:25.176 --> 00:40:27.786 A:middle
They afford you a different
way of manipulating them,

745
00:40:27.906 --> 00:40:29.156 A:middle
of interacting with them.

746
00:40:29.916 --> 00:40:33.146 A:middle
We learn this stuff
from our earliest ages

747
00:40:33.406 --> 00:40:34.696 A:middle
of childhood development.

748
00:40:34.956 --> 00:40:37.396 A:middle
It's how we interface
with the world.

749
00:40:37.946 --> 00:40:40.586 A:middle
So interface, it's
really important

750
00:40:40.586 --> 00:40:42.676 A:middle
in your user interface design
to think about this stuff

751
00:40:42.676 --> 00:40:45.266 A:middle
and be conscious of these
visual cues that we use

752
00:40:45.266 --> 00:40:47.486 A:middle
to understand how to
interact with things.

753
00:40:48.756 --> 00:40:54.206 A:middle
So with that in mind, I want
to draw your attention to this.

754
00:40:55.396 --> 00:40:58.376 A:middle
There's this blue rounded
rectangle in the background

755
00:40:58.376 --> 00:41:01.276 A:middle
of all this data that we saw in
the previous version of Weather

756
00:41:01.556 --> 00:41:03.406 A:middle
and it was there for a
very specific purpose.

757
00:41:03.406 --> 00:41:05.976 A:middle
It looks a little
bit like a card,

758
00:41:06.496 --> 00:41:08.846 A:middle
like a playing card
right, business card.

759
00:41:09.696 --> 00:41:11.946 A:middle
The affordance of a
card when it's sitting

760
00:41:11.946 --> 00:41:14.636 A:middle
on a table is something that
you can take with one finger

761
00:41:14.636 --> 00:41:19.026 A:middle
and swipe it around, so it's
perfect to indicate to people

762
00:41:19.026 --> 00:41:19.976 A:middle
that they can do this.

763
00:41:20.466 --> 00:41:25.526 A:middle
And when it flips around
that feels natural.

764
00:41:25.896 --> 00:41:26.706 A:middle
Cards flip around.

765
00:41:27.696 --> 00:41:28.696 A:middle
It's really straight forward.

766
00:41:29.086 --> 00:41:31.686 A:middle
But there was a third
element which none

767
00:41:31.686 --> 00:41:34.126 A:middle
of us were familiar with,
which is this page control.

768
00:41:34.716 --> 00:41:37.216 A:middle
We had to learn the
meaning of that

769
00:41:37.216 --> 00:41:38.926 A:middle
and it was a really
easy thing to learn.

770
00:41:38.926 --> 00:41:40.816 A:middle
I mean it only takes
a couple minutes

771
00:41:42.266 --> 00:41:43.816 A:middle
but that didn't exist before.

772
00:41:45.356 --> 00:41:50.636 A:middle
So with that, do we need the
card to tell you you can swipe?

773
00:41:51.006 --> 00:41:53.466 A:middle
In fact, now swiping
is so natural for us

774
00:41:53.466 --> 00:41:55.646 A:middle
when we use an iPhone or an iPad

775
00:41:55.646 --> 00:41:57.456 A:middle
that we just try to
swipe everything.

776
00:41:57.576 --> 00:41:58.546 A:middle
We try to pinch everything,

777
00:41:58.546 --> 00:42:01.066 A:middle
rotate everything,
we play with it.

778
00:42:01.066 --> 00:42:02.106 A:middle
It feels comfortable.

779
00:42:02.106 --> 00:42:04.026 A:middle
We expect these gestures
to be there.

780
00:42:04.616 --> 00:42:06.506 A:middle
We don't need it.

781
00:42:06.506 --> 00:42:08.826 A:middle
We got rid of it.

782
00:42:08.826 --> 00:42:10.716 A:middle
It was an unnecessary
ornamentation

783
00:42:11.086 --> 00:42:13.916 A:middle
and as a result there
was more space to use

784
00:42:13.916 --> 00:42:17.376 A:middle
for displaying what really
matters here, the information

785
00:42:17.376 --> 00:42:18.876 A:middle
about the current
weather conditions.

786
00:42:18.876 --> 00:42:21.966 A:middle
It's amazing what taking
over that little amount

787
00:42:21.966 --> 00:42:28.066 A:middle
of space accomplishes, 640
pixels to display data.

788
00:42:29.556 --> 00:42:32.376 A:middle
So you can make text larger
and it be more legible.

789
00:42:32.846 --> 00:42:34.836 A:middle
You have room for
additional information

790
00:42:35.086 --> 00:42:36.506 A:middle
like the current
weather conditions.

791
00:42:36.966 --> 00:42:39.976 A:middle
Now that background does a
really good job of telling you

792
00:42:39.976 --> 00:42:41.676 A:middle
that it's snowing or it's
raining or it's going

793
00:42:41.676 --> 00:42:42.906 A:middle
to be sunny or whatever,

794
00:42:42.906 --> 00:42:48.216 A:middle
but if there's any ambiguity
whatsoever, that text nails it,

795
00:42:49.096 --> 00:42:50.856 A:middle
Takes all the guesswork
out of it.

796
00:42:50.856 --> 00:42:54.856 A:middle
So again information is
expressed as clearly as possible

797
00:42:55.276 --> 00:42:57.106 A:middle
and often times that's
done with text.

798
00:42:57.466 --> 00:43:02.306 A:middle
As a result Weather is a simple,

799
00:43:02.846 --> 00:43:05.786 A:middle
beautiful app that's
really easy to use.

800
00:43:06.086 --> 00:43:08.896 A:middle
Its form serves its function.

801
00:43:09.426 --> 00:43:10.876 A:middle
It's a pure expression of it.

802
00:43:11.996 --> 00:43:13.376 A:middle
This is clarity in design.

803
00:43:13.906 --> 00:43:17.066 A:middle
Let's move onto the Compass.

804
00:43:17.456 --> 00:43:23.876 A:middle
Now I love the Compass app but I
want to start with a little bit

805
00:43:23.876 --> 00:43:26.446 A:middle
of discussion about realism.

806
00:43:27.106 --> 00:43:29.286 A:middle
Now this is going to be
a little bit redundant

807
00:43:29.286 --> 00:43:30.566 A:middle
but I think this is
kind of important.

808
00:43:31.096 --> 00:43:37.486 A:middle
The previous version of
Compass looked like this kind

809
00:43:37.486 --> 00:43:39.266 A:middle
of nice looking thing
that you would find

810
00:43:39.266 --> 00:43:40.966 A:middle
on a yacht or something.

811
00:43:40.966 --> 00:43:42.316 A:middle
I don't know, I've
never been on one,

812
00:43:42.766 --> 00:43:46.266 A:middle
but it was really
carefully crafted

813
00:43:46.266 --> 00:43:51.646 A:middle
and it was really attractive,
pretty, but was it necessary

814
00:43:52.576 --> 00:43:53.526 A:middle
to make it look like this

815
00:43:53.526 --> 00:43:56.676 A:middle
so that we would understand
how to use a compass?

816
00:43:57.256 --> 00:43:59.256 A:middle
Was it necessary to
design it this way

817
00:43:59.946 --> 00:44:02.146 A:middle
so you understood
what this was for?

818
00:44:02.656 --> 00:44:06.276 A:middle
No. And did it limit what
was possible with Compass?

819
00:44:06.566 --> 00:44:08.656 A:middle
Yes. Let's look at why.

820
00:44:09.636 --> 00:44:12.056 A:middle
So in the center of the dial
there's this four points

821
00:44:12.056 --> 00:44:14.506 A:middle
adornment and this
capstone and that took

822
00:44:14.506 --> 00:44:15.816 A:middle
up quite a bit of space.

823
00:44:16.876 --> 00:44:21.006 A:middle
By getting rid of that we could
put a level right in the center.

824
00:44:21.636 --> 00:44:23.676 A:middle
That makes Compass more useful.

825
00:44:24.286 --> 00:44:26.986 A:middle
It's a direct tradeoff
between the desire

826
00:44:26.986 --> 00:44:29.756 A:middle
to have this ornamentation
and the desire

827
00:44:30.126 --> 00:44:32.076 A:middle
to have more functionality.

828
00:44:32.496 --> 00:44:33.976 A:middle
So the decision is really clear.

829
00:44:35.476 --> 00:44:37.066 A:middle
Making it more useful
is important.

830
00:44:37.556 --> 00:44:44.226 A:middle
As a result Compass
is clean it's elegant.

831
00:44:44.946 --> 00:44:47.226 A:middle
It's the expression of
what a Compass should be

832
00:44:47.226 --> 00:44:51.066 A:middle
on this device, not what a
compass should be on a boat.

833
00:44:55.536 --> 00:44:58.606 A:middle
And also when you turn and
face a different direction,

834
00:44:59.996 --> 00:45:02.426 A:middle
the letters stay upright
so they're more legible.

835
00:45:02.766 --> 00:45:05.996 A:middle
Again, if we had done this
with the previous Compass,

836
00:45:06.446 --> 00:45:08.426 A:middle
it would have totally
ruined the illusion.

837
00:45:08.806 --> 00:45:11.166 A:middle
Those two things are at
odds with each other.

838
00:45:11.746 --> 00:45:15.996 A:middle
A little bit more about color.

839
00:45:15.996 --> 00:45:18.516 A:middle
So you notice there's
this red color in Compass

840
00:45:18.956 --> 00:45:21.026 A:middle
and there's something really
special about that red.

841
00:45:22.406 --> 00:45:26.996 A:middle
That red is the same red
that we saw in Calendar.

842
00:45:27.186 --> 00:45:28.816 A:middle
It's the same red that
you'll see in Stocks.

843
00:45:28.816 --> 00:45:30.516 A:middle
It's the same red that
you see in Stop Watch.

844
00:45:30.996 --> 00:45:33.976 A:middle
It's the same red you'll
find in a lot of places.

845
00:45:34.566 --> 00:45:40.006 A:middle
This color pallet was designed
to be carefully balanced

846
00:45:40.276 --> 00:45:42.676 A:middle
to be clean and vibrant,
beautiful,

847
00:45:42.676 --> 00:45:48.296 A:middle
and our products use these
colors with great restraint.

848
00:45:49.476 --> 00:45:50.836 A:middle
You don't want to
just arbitrarily pick

849
00:45:50.836 --> 00:45:52.266 A:middle
different application.

850
00:45:52.266 --> 00:45:54.346 A:middle
It makes things start to
fragment and fall apart,

851
00:45:54.406 --> 00:45:56.336 A:middle
and that too applies
to your app.

852
00:45:56.856 --> 00:45:59.426 A:middle
If you use color, use
it with restraint.

853
00:46:00.566 --> 00:46:03.266 A:middle
Carefully select colors
that look really good

854
00:46:03.846 --> 00:46:07.106 A:middle
and don't just arbitrarily pick
different colors at random.

855
00:46:07.586 --> 00:46:12.376 A:middle
It's going to make your UI
feel fragmented, incoherent.

856
00:46:14.976 --> 00:46:16.836 A:middle
All right, Settings.

857
00:46:17.356 --> 00:46:19.136 A:middle
Now Settings is a great
way to see how all

858
00:46:19.136 --> 00:46:21.426 A:middle
of the UIKit controls
have changed.

859
00:46:22.496 --> 00:46:25.156 A:middle
So I encourage you to open
up Settings and play around

860
00:46:25.156 --> 00:46:26.396 A:middle
and look at some of
the different controls

861
00:46:26.396 --> 00:46:34.946 A:middle
that are there, but I want to
focus on three of those today.

862
00:46:35.176 --> 00:46:38.696 A:middle
Switches. Now Switches
have changed a lot.

863
00:46:39.986 --> 00:46:42.286 A:middle
Instead of using text to show
you that the switch is off

864
00:46:42.446 --> 00:46:47.606 A:middle
or on, you see there's
just a nice solid color

865
00:46:47.736 --> 00:46:49.556 A:middle
which is expressing
that information.

866
00:46:50.986 --> 00:46:55.006 A:middle
And the reason why that can
work is because it's consistent

867
00:46:55.006 --> 00:46:57.936 A:middle
with so many other controls
that you'll see in iOS 7.

868
00:46:58.316 --> 00:47:00.716 A:middle
Selection is shown in
this consistent way

869
00:47:00.986 --> 00:47:05.696 A:middle
so each control reinforces
how selection is indicated.

870
00:47:06.206 --> 00:47:09.336 A:middle
Date Pickers.

871
00:47:10.086 --> 00:47:11.296 A:middle
Now these have changed
quite a bit.

872
00:47:12.486 --> 00:47:16.586 A:middle
No longer do you see all of
this glossy, different colors

873
00:47:16.586 --> 00:47:20.586 A:middle
of blue, glass, inter-shadows,
highlights and all this stuff,

874
00:47:20.586 --> 00:47:21.726 A:middle
all this ornamentation.

875
00:47:23.146 --> 00:47:26.156 A:middle
What you see instead
is some clean text

876
00:47:26.436 --> 00:47:29.146 A:middle
which has been distorted
in such a way to suggest

877
00:47:29.146 --> 00:47:32.036 A:middle
that these are printed
on wheels and because

878
00:47:32.036 --> 00:47:35.246 A:middle
of that you get a sense that
you can just swipe these up

879
00:47:35.246 --> 00:47:36.876 A:middle
and down to change the values.

880
00:47:37.486 --> 00:47:40.876 A:middle
Kind of relates to this
concept of continuation.

881
00:47:40.876 --> 00:47:43.236 A:middle
Our mind has to make sense of
why these are being distorted

882
00:47:43.236 --> 00:47:45.346 A:middle
and we make sense
of it by thinking

883
00:47:45.346 --> 00:47:46.776 A:middle
about then as being on a wheel.

884
00:47:47.356 --> 00:47:51.656 A:middle
Now we don't need these
strong vertical dividing lines

885
00:47:51.726 --> 00:47:52.816 A:middle
to separate the values.

886
00:47:53.206 --> 00:47:56.166 A:middle
A little bit of negative space
will do the trick just fine,

887
00:47:56.996 --> 00:48:00.746 A:middle
and which value is selected
is really easy to see

888
00:48:00.876 --> 00:48:01.906 A:middle
because it's darker text,

889
00:48:01.906 --> 00:48:04.066 A:middle
it's right in the center,
it totally obvious.

890
00:48:04.106 --> 00:48:06.716 A:middle
You don't need that blue glass

891
00:48:07.066 --> 00:48:09.206 A:middle
to show you what the
current value is.

892
00:48:10.026 --> 00:48:12.306 A:middle
And as a result of
these changes,

893
00:48:13.326 --> 00:48:14.826 A:middle
it works really well inline.

894
00:48:15.046 --> 00:48:20.236 A:middle
You don't have to go to a
separate view to adjust the date

895
00:48:20.536 --> 00:48:22.486 A:middle
or adjust the value
of time in this case,

896
00:48:22.816 --> 00:48:26.156 A:middle
and that's important too.

897
00:48:27.436 --> 00:48:30.116 A:middle
Going to a separate view
means you lose your context.

898
00:48:30.716 --> 00:48:32.986 A:middle
Perhaps there's some
information in the previous view

899
00:48:33.216 --> 00:48:35.826 A:middle
that you need to make
the decision in the view

900
00:48:35.826 --> 00:48:37.876 A:middle
that you've just gone to and now
you're going to have to go back

901
00:48:37.876 --> 00:48:39.846 A:middle
and forth and memorize.

902
00:48:41.046 --> 00:48:44.136 A:middle
Displaying something
inline allows you to stay

903
00:48:44.136 --> 00:48:46.406 A:middle
in the context you were
in before and swiping up

904
00:48:46.406 --> 00:48:48.086 A:middle
and down is really easy.

905
00:48:49.176 --> 00:48:52.246 A:middle
This is an example
of a simple design

906
00:48:52.496 --> 00:48:53.806 A:middle
that has tremendous depth.

907
00:48:55.186 --> 00:48:56.446 A:middle
And finally, Back buttons.

908
00:48:56.626 --> 00:49:00.686 A:middle
Now, to get back previously you
would press on the Back button.

909
00:49:01.176 --> 00:49:04.746 A:middle
That makes sense and you still
do that but now with the iPhone,

910
00:49:04.746 --> 00:49:06.446 A:middle
I don't have one on
me, I can't show you,

911
00:49:07.056 --> 00:49:08.716 A:middle
you swipe in from the left edge

912
00:49:09.416 --> 00:49:11.356 A:middle
and that allows you
to get back as well.

913
00:49:12.366 --> 00:49:14.706 A:middle
So let's look at how that works

914
00:49:15.056 --> 00:49:16.876 A:middle
but pay close attention
to the Back button.

915
00:49:17.416 --> 00:49:21.136 A:middle
See how it just slides over
and morphs into the title?

916
00:49:21.756 --> 00:49:24.136 A:middle
It's kind of an obvious thing.

917
00:49:24.686 --> 00:49:25.616 A:middle
So intuitive.

918
00:49:25.876 --> 00:49:28.676 A:middle
It clearly shows that
parent child relationship

919
00:49:28.746 --> 00:49:31.436 A:middle
and clearly shows you that
you're moving from one level

920
00:49:31.436 --> 00:49:32.756 A:middle
in the hierarchy to another.

921
00:49:33.386 --> 00:49:35.066 A:middle
It's really elegant.

922
00:49:36.186 --> 00:49:36.606 A:middle
I like it.

923
00:49:37.156 --> 00:49:38.716 A:middle
All right, Control Center.

924
00:49:38.966 --> 00:49:41.466 A:middle
Now, you've heard a lot about
Control Center, I'm not going

925
00:49:41.466 --> 00:49:44.136 A:middle
to repeat all of that, but I
want to talk about layering.

926
00:49:44.856 --> 00:49:47.686 A:middle
We can see here we've brought up
Control Center and we're looking

927
00:49:47.686 --> 00:49:50.016 A:middle
at the very top of that
and we know that we're

928
00:49:50.016 --> 00:49:52.316 A:middle
at the Home screen because
we can still see the app

929
00:49:52.316 --> 00:49:53.486 A:middle
icons behind.

930
00:49:54.676 --> 00:49:57.346 A:middle
That transparency it
provides this sense of depth

931
00:49:57.906 --> 00:50:01.786 A:middle
and the colors coming through
just reinforces that sense

932
00:50:01.786 --> 00:50:05.266 A:middle
of depth, and that's
important because you bring

933
00:50:05.266 --> 00:50:07.216 A:middle
up the Control Center in all of
these different applications.

934
00:50:07.216 --> 00:50:09.406 A:middle
I brought it up here in Mail and
I know that I'm still in Mail

935
00:50:09.406 --> 00:50:12.126 A:middle
so when I dismiss the Control
Center I'm going to be back

936
00:50:12.166 --> 00:50:16.186 A:middle
in Mail or Compass or Calendar.

937
00:50:17.136 --> 00:50:18.556 A:middle
My context is maintained.

938
00:50:19.436 --> 00:50:21.066 A:middle
And you guys can apply
that to your apps too.

939
00:50:21.066 --> 00:50:23.996 A:middle
You can use layering
to bring in things

940
00:50:23.996 --> 00:50:25.896 A:middle
that people need quick access
to and then they're going

941
00:50:25.896 --> 00:50:27.886 A:middle
to dismiss and go back to
where they were before,

942
00:50:27.886 --> 00:50:29.916 A:middle
but their context is maintained.

943
00:50:31.606 --> 00:50:32.606 A:middle
It's really fluid.

944
00:50:32.756 --> 00:50:33.846 A:middle
It makes things really easy.

945
00:50:34.596 --> 00:50:36.166 A:middle
And it just looks pretty.

946
00:50:38.416 --> 00:50:40.486 A:middle
All right, last but not
least, the Home screen.

947
00:50:40.846 --> 00:50:45.586 A:middle
Now as we saw, the Home screen
has remained structurally the

948
00:50:45.586 --> 00:50:48.506 A:middle
same as it was before
and why not?

949
00:50:48.506 --> 00:50:50.256 A:middle
It's a really great interface.

950
00:50:50.576 --> 00:50:53.816 A:middle
So all the interactions about
deleting app icons and swiping

951
00:50:53.816 --> 00:50:55.566 A:middle
between Home screens
and reordering and that,

952
00:50:55.746 --> 00:50:58.646 A:middle
it's all the same, but
the icons have changed

953
00:50:58.646 --> 00:51:01.116 A:middle
so we'll spend a little bit of
time talking about these icons.

954
00:51:02.446 --> 00:51:06.726 A:middle
Gone are the heaviest of
textures, the stripes,

955
00:51:07.216 --> 00:51:12.506 A:middle
the light rays, the glossy
overlays and the photo realism.

956
00:51:14.076 --> 00:51:18.756 A:middle
The Safari icon, for example,
has been greatly simplified.

957
00:51:19.756 --> 00:51:23.366 A:middle
Safari is represented by a
compass and it doesn't take much

958
00:51:23.476 --> 00:51:26.516 A:middle
to communicate the concept of a
compass, to depict that image.

959
00:51:26.966 --> 00:51:30.476 A:middle
All you need is a red and
white needle, circular dial

960
00:51:30.476 --> 00:51:31.536 A:middle
and maybe some tick marks.

961
00:51:31.646 --> 00:51:32.126 A:middle
That's it.

962
00:51:32.856 --> 00:51:35.836 A:middle
If you start to add other stuff
it becomes busy and heavy.

963
00:51:36.536 --> 00:51:38.896 A:middle
So you don't need the
cardinal directions

964
00:51:38.896 --> 00:51:40.236 A:middle
of North, East, South and West.

965
00:51:40.236 --> 00:51:41.876 A:middle
You don't need the
globe background.

966
00:51:41.876 --> 00:51:43.096 A:middle
You don't need the
glossy overlay.

967
00:51:43.096 --> 00:51:45.226 A:middle
You don't need the
specular highlights

968
00:51:45.226 --> 00:51:47.446 A:middle
and the drop shadows
and all that stuff.

969
00:51:48.836 --> 00:51:52.216 A:middle
The result is a cleaner shape
that's easier to identify.

970
00:51:52.426 --> 00:51:53.006 A:middle
It's simpler.

971
00:51:53.006 --> 00:51:55.966 A:middle
There's less stuff
coming at you.

972
00:51:56.796 --> 00:51:59.866 A:middle
And when you see this along
a bunch of other app icons

973
00:51:59.866 --> 00:52:00.576 A:middle
that all have a bunch

974
00:52:00.576 --> 00:52:02.686 A:middle
of ornamentation it
becomes hard to find stuff.

975
00:52:03.846 --> 00:52:05.996 A:middle
Now we've been providing
this advice for some time now

976
00:52:06.076 --> 00:52:07.956 A:middle
and now we're kind
of listening to it.

977
00:52:08.176 --> 00:52:10.646 A:middle
It's really nice
to find a clean,

978
00:52:10.696 --> 00:52:13.266 A:middle
simple shape and just one color.

979
00:52:13.696 --> 00:52:15.786 A:middle
Makes app icons stand
out really well.

980
00:52:17.226 --> 00:52:19.836 A:middle
And of course the color that's
chosen matches the tint color

981
00:52:19.836 --> 00:52:20.756 A:middle
from the applications.

982
00:52:21.686 --> 00:52:23.286 A:middle
You want to have that
kind of consistency.

983
00:52:29.676 --> 00:52:32.886 A:middle
Now, many of you might ask,
well, if you're simplifying,

984
00:52:33.166 --> 00:52:34.336 A:middle
getting rid of all
this ornamentation,

985
00:52:34.336 --> 00:52:35.096 A:middle
what about the gradients?

986
00:52:35.096 --> 00:52:36.766 A:middle
Why don't you just
use a solid color?

987
00:52:36.766 --> 00:52:37.956 A:middle
That's going to be
a lot simpler.

988
00:52:38.346 --> 00:52:43.306 A:middle
Well, perhaps, but it turns
out it's also really boring.

989
00:52:44.416 --> 00:52:46.716 A:middle
Vibrancy, life, that's
important.

990
00:52:47.446 --> 00:52:48.806 A:middle
Those are really
important values

991
00:52:48.806 --> 00:52:51.766 A:middle
and these gradients they add
that but in a subtle way,

992
00:52:51.796 --> 00:52:55.046 A:middle
but it still makes it so much
more visually interesting.

993
00:52:56.956 --> 00:53:00.146 A:middle
Now these icons they're
simpler but the approach

994
00:53:00.146 --> 00:53:01.916 A:middle
to designing them
wasn't simplistic.

995
00:53:02.406 --> 00:53:05.456 A:middle
So to demonstrate, I'm going to
replay that video that we saw

996
00:53:05.456 --> 00:53:06.166 A:middle
at the very beginning.

997
00:53:06.666 --> 00:53:22.656 A:middle
[ Silence ]

998
00:53:23.156 --> 00:53:24.286 A:middle
It's kind of a nice video.

999
00:53:25.556 --> 00:53:30.266 A:middle
All of our app icons were
designed using this grid,

1000
00:53:30.446 --> 00:53:34.746 A:middle
this template, to give them
consistency and composition.

1001
00:53:35.316 --> 00:53:37.726 A:middle
So they're connected at
this really deep level.

1002
00:53:39.226 --> 00:53:42.126 A:middle
This template, it's
really balanced.

1003
00:53:43.056 --> 00:53:44.886 A:middle
I spent some time
recreating this and I got

1004
00:53:44.886 --> 00:53:48.606 A:middle
to appreciate the subtlety of it
and why all the lines are placed

1005
00:53:48.606 --> 00:53:50.626 A:middle
where they are and how
the circles work with that

1006
00:53:51.986 --> 00:53:53.726 A:middle
and it's sophisticated stuff.

1007
00:53:54.116 --> 00:53:54.666 A:middle
It's kind of cool.

1008
00:53:54.666 --> 00:53:55.486 A:middle
I was impressed.

1009
00:53:56.036 --> 00:54:02.416 A:middle
But as a result of following
this template our icons share

1010
00:54:02.796 --> 00:54:06.236 A:middle
things like this blue dot
in Stocks aligns perfectly

1011
00:54:06.236 --> 00:54:08.256 A:middle
with the corner of
that intersection.

1012
00:54:09.956 --> 00:54:14.756 A:middle
The circular shape of the
Safari icon matches perfectly

1013
00:54:15.746 --> 00:54:19.136 A:middle
with the iTunes Store
icon and the Photos icon.

1014
00:54:19.636 --> 00:54:24.006 A:middle
Alright I'm running low on time
so I want to go quickly forward.

1015
00:54:24.436 --> 00:54:26.916 A:middle
One thing to point out, you guys
should all be aware of this,

1016
00:54:27.006 --> 00:54:28.716 A:middle
the app icons are now
a little bit bigger,

1017
00:54:28.716 --> 00:54:31.176 A:middle
so you don't want
your icons to scale,

1018
00:54:31.896 --> 00:54:35.616 A:middle
be best to deliver all work
at this size, 120 by 120.

1019
00:54:36.636 --> 00:54:39.316 A:middle
So all of these icons
they have colors,

1020
00:54:39.316 --> 00:54:40.346 A:middle
they have different features,

1021
00:54:40.856 --> 00:54:43.036 A:middle
but everything was done
with great restraint.

1022
00:54:43.286 --> 00:54:46.836 A:middle
If it didn't help to communicate
the meaning of the app,

1023
00:54:47.106 --> 00:54:49.576 A:middle
what its function
was, it was removed.

1024
00:54:49.576 --> 00:54:51.826 A:middle
If it didn't help to
differentiate one icon

1025
00:54:51.826 --> 00:54:54.406 A:middle
from the next and help them
stand out, it was removed.

1026
00:54:55.336 --> 00:54:57.646 A:middle
And as a result it's a
simpler set of icons.

1027
00:54:58.126 --> 00:54:59.056 A:middle
It's easier on the eye.

1028
00:54:59.706 --> 00:55:02.386 A:middle
So some final thoughts.

1029
00:55:03.916 --> 00:55:09.716 A:middle
The values that were at the
heart of iOS 7 were clarity,

1030
00:55:10.526 --> 00:55:13.706 A:middle
deference, depth and detail.

1031
00:55:15.526 --> 00:55:17.146 A:middle
Let's talk about
those because I think

1032
00:55:17.886 --> 00:55:20.656 A:middle
if you guys take anything away
from today it should be this.

1033
00:55:20.956 --> 00:55:22.866 A:middle
It's really powerful stuff.

1034
00:55:23.956 --> 00:55:28.696 A:middle
Clarity. We saw what
clarity meant in Compass.

1035
00:55:29.626 --> 00:55:32.966 A:middle
It meant doing nothing more
than showing you information

1036
00:55:32.966 --> 00:55:34.376 A:middle
and express functionality.

1037
00:55:35.556 --> 00:55:38.026 A:middle
Nothing more and nothing less.

1038
00:55:41.536 --> 00:55:42.546 A:middle
Deference.

1039
00:55:44.036 --> 00:55:48.926 A:middle
Deference in Mail meant making
sure that text is large,

1040
00:55:49.846 --> 00:55:56.176 A:middle
resizable, legible and
gorgeous, and photos are large

1041
00:55:56.646 --> 00:56:02.576 A:middle
so you can see the detail.

1042
00:56:04.296 --> 00:56:06.206 A:middle
Depth. Now I didn't
show this before

1043
00:56:06.766 --> 00:56:09.206 A:middle
but I think this is really
cool so let's look at this now.

1044
00:56:09.646 --> 00:56:13.856 A:middle
When you swipe up to see
the Camera and you let go,

1045
00:56:14.296 --> 00:56:15.616 A:middle
see it bounces a little bit?

1046
00:56:15.996 --> 00:56:18.786 A:middle
And it bounces differently based
on the height you drop in from.

1047
00:56:18.846 --> 00:56:21.736 A:middle
You can even slam it down
and it really bounces.

1048
00:56:22.266 --> 00:56:28.136 A:middle
That provides such a
sense of physical realism.

1049
00:56:28.676 --> 00:56:30.736 A:middle
Makes it so much more
lifelike and believable.

1050
00:56:32.156 --> 00:56:33.216 A:middle
You guys could do that too.

1051
00:56:33.456 --> 00:56:35.766 A:middle
UI Dynamics, with
its physics engine,

1052
00:56:35.766 --> 00:56:39.266 A:middle
is going to really enable people
to do some amazing stuff here.

1053
00:56:41.776 --> 00:56:44.746 A:middle
The Home screen and the
way we have these distinct,

1054
00:56:44.746 --> 00:56:47.456 A:middle
functional planes that are
separated from each other

1055
00:56:47.456 --> 00:56:53.326 A:middle
and respond to the
movement of the device.

1056
00:56:53.476 --> 00:56:55.676 A:middle
And detail, detail
brings it all together.

1057
00:57:00.496 --> 00:57:02.526 A:middle
So you've seen what
it meant for us.

1058
00:57:03.426 --> 00:57:06.506 A:middle
You've seen what these
new tools allowed Apple

1059
00:57:06.656 --> 00:57:10.406 A:middle
to do with apps in iOS 7.

1060
00:57:11.236 --> 00:57:15.126 A:middle
How are your apps going
to have more depth?

1061
00:57:15.646 --> 00:57:19.616 A:middle
How can you use behaviors and
motion effects and transitions

1062
00:57:20.196 --> 00:57:24.796 A:middle
and layering to improve the
experience of your apps?

1063
00:57:25.996 --> 00:57:28.566 A:middle
How are you going to be more
deferential in your apps?

1064
00:57:28.956 --> 00:57:30.916 A:middle
What do users care about most?

1065
00:57:30.916 --> 00:57:33.026 A:middle
What's the content that's
most important to them?

1066
00:57:33.486 --> 00:57:35.386 A:middle
How can you get out
of their way?

1067
00:57:36.066 --> 00:57:37.846 A:middle
And clarity.

1068
00:57:38.546 --> 00:57:40.406 A:middle
What's the functionality
of your app?

1069
00:57:41.156 --> 00:57:42.896 A:middle
What's the information
you're trying to express?

1070
00:57:43.236 --> 00:57:45.476 A:middle
How can you do a
better job of that?

1071
00:57:46.026 --> 00:57:47.326 A:middle
How can you prioritize things

1072
00:57:47.326 --> 00:57:50.966 A:middle
and make things simpler
for people?

1073
00:57:51.126 --> 00:57:54.006 A:middle
Now, this is a really
exciting time

1074
00:57:54.746 --> 00:57:58.196 A:middle
to be doing interface design and
talking about it and thinking

1075
00:57:58.196 --> 00:58:01.026 A:middle
about it, for you
developers making apps.

1076
00:58:02.056 --> 00:58:06.416 A:middle
There's some amazing new tools
in iOS 7 and we've applied those

1077
00:58:06.866 --> 00:58:09.896 A:middle
to the apps that ship
with the devices.

1078
00:58:10.656 --> 00:58:12.586 A:middle
But we're just scratching
the surface.

1079
00:58:13.056 --> 00:58:18.446 A:middle
There's 800,000 apps in the App
Store, 6 million developers,

1080
00:58:19.126 --> 00:58:22.756 A:middle
some of the brightest minds
in the world are spending all

1081
00:58:22.756 --> 00:58:25.356 A:middle
of their time, you guys,
you're spending all

1082
00:58:25.356 --> 00:58:27.126 A:middle
of your time using all
of that brain power

1083
00:58:27.126 --> 00:58:29.096 A:middle
to do some amazing
things with your apps.

1084
00:58:29.846 --> 00:58:32.266 A:middle
What are you going to
do with this stuff?

1085
00:58:33.596 --> 00:58:35.616 A:middle
It's really exciting because
we're at the precipice of that.

1086
00:58:36.096 --> 00:58:38.806 A:middle
We're at the beginning
of a whole new phase

1087
00:58:38.806 --> 00:58:41.866 A:middle
of software development
for mobile devices.

1088
00:58:42.476 --> 00:58:46.276 A:middle
I have no idea what you're going
to make but I know it's going

1089
00:58:46.276 --> 00:58:49.616 A:middle
to be awesome and I'm
really looking forward

1090
00:58:49.616 --> 00:58:51.396 A:middle
to when we come back
together next year

1091
00:58:51.686 --> 00:58:54.236 A:middle
and seeing what was done
over the course of that year.

1092
00:58:54.616 --> 00:58:56.356 A:middle
It's going to be mind-blowing.

1093
00:58:57.556 --> 00:59:00.576 A:middle
So go out there,
make some cool stuff

1094
00:59:01.436 --> 00:59:02.726 A:middle
and let's regroup in a year.

1095
00:59:03.236 --> 00:59:04.426 A:middle
Thank you very much.
