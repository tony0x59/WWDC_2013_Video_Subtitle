morning everyone.

00:00:18.876 --> 00:00:20.186 A:middle
My name is Mike Stern.

5
00:00:20.336 --> 00:00:24.676 A:middle
I'm Apple's User Experience
Evangelist and I'm really happy

6
00:00:24.676 --> 00:00:27.996 A:middle
to be talking again today
about design for iOS.

7
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.796 A:middle
Now, if you saw my
talk on Wednesday,

8
00:00:31.256 --> 00:00:33.066 A:middle
you heard me speak a
lot about the difference

9
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.326 A:middle
between iOS 6 and iOS 7.

10
00:00:35.726 --> 00:00:39.776 A:middle
Well today, we're going talk
about Evergreen Design advice.

11
00:00:40.636 --> 00:00:44.486 A:middle
So this is advice that is
relevant if you're making an app

12
00:00:44.536 --> 00:00:48.506 A:middle
for iOS 7 but it was
relevant for 6 and 5

13
00:00:48.576 --> 00:00:53.326 A:middle
and every version
of iOS before that.

14
00:00:53.506 --> 00:00:57.326 A:middle
So, as many of you know,
we spend a lot of time

15
00:00:57.326 --> 00:01:00.616 A:middle
and energy creating
apps at Apple.

16
00:01:00.916 --> 00:01:02.806 A:middle
We focus on it, we
want to make sure

17
00:01:02.806 --> 00:01:06.196 A:middle
that user experience
is really fantastic.

18
00:01:07.636 --> 00:01:11.866 A:middle
And I've been a designer at
Apple for seven years and I know

19
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:15.486 A:middle
at first hand how much care and
thought goes into the design

20
00:01:15.486 --> 00:01:18.186 A:middle
of each one of our
apps, and it shows.

21
00:01:19.426 --> 00:01:24.306 A:middle
Our users have come to expect
experiences that are intuitive,

22
00:01:25.836 --> 00:01:33.516 A:middle
engaging, beautiful, and
sometimes a bit magical.

23
00:01:38.076 --> 00:01:41.766 A:middle
And you guys heard all week long
about the great new technologies

24
00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:44.416 A:middle
that you could take advantage
of for designing your apps.

25
00:01:45.626 --> 00:01:48.356 A:middle
And I hope you guys learned
a lot and have come away

26
00:01:48.356 --> 00:01:51.086 A:middle
from this week really inspired
to try some of these new things.

27
00:01:51.946 --> 00:01:53.596 A:middle
But the thing I want
to remind you of is

28
00:01:53.596 --> 00:01:56.936 A:middle
that your users aren't going
to judge your apps based

29
00:01:56.936 --> 00:02:01.956 A:middle
on how many technologies you use
or how many APIs you integrated

30
00:02:02.336 --> 00:02:03.756 A:middle
or how elegant your code is.

31
00:02:04.906 --> 00:02:07.256 A:middle
The way they're going to
judge your app is based

32
00:02:07.256 --> 00:02:11.526 A:middle
on what enables them to
do, how it makes them feel.

33
00:02:12.106 --> 00:02:16.016 A:middle
So with that in mind, it's
really important that the design

34
00:02:16.016 --> 00:02:20.006 A:middle
of your app has the same
qualities of being intuitive

35
00:02:20.546 --> 00:02:22.396 A:middle
and engaging and beautiful.

36
00:02:22.926 --> 00:02:27.436 A:middle
And we saw on Monday,
some of the winners

37
00:02:27.436 --> 00:02:34.346 A:middle
of the Apple Design Awards, apps
like ProCreate, WWF Together,

38
00:02:34.556 --> 00:02:37.676 A:middle
Ridiculous Fishing,
Badland, Yahoo!

39
00:02:37.676 --> 00:02:39.186 A:middle
Weather, and Letterpress.

40
00:02:39.876 --> 00:02:45.566 A:middle
These apps, they set the bar for
high quality user experience.

41
00:02:46.716 --> 00:02:51.266 A:middle
I worked on this a little
bit and I got to see dozens,

42
00:02:51.626 --> 00:02:54.206 A:middle
hundreds of apps
that we considered

43
00:02:55.096 --> 00:02:58.166 A:middle
for the final selection and
it was a really tough choice.

44
00:02:58.446 --> 00:03:01.156 A:middle
There's so many great apps
being designed for iOS,

45
00:03:01.946 --> 00:03:03.576 A:middle
many of them only for iOS.

46
00:03:03.906 --> 00:03:08.056 A:middle
But this is tough competition.

47
00:03:08.576 --> 00:03:09.546 A:middle
So how do you get here?

48
00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.666 A:middle
How do you start going
in this direction?

49
00:03:14.436 --> 00:03:20.256 A:middle
Now, I look at a lot of apps
all the time and I see some

50
00:03:20.256 --> 00:03:22.766 A:middle
of the same mistakes being
made over and over again.

51
00:03:24.166 --> 00:03:27.446 A:middle
And as we know, a lot
of apps get rejected

52
00:03:27.556 --> 00:03:30.026 A:middle
from the App Store
during the review process.

53
00:03:30.566 --> 00:03:35.676 A:middle
In fact, it's one of the top
three reasons why apps get

54
00:03:35.676 --> 00:03:37.646 A:middle
rejected-- why apps
will get rejected.

55
00:03:38.576 --> 00:03:40.306 A:middle
So, I'd like to head
that off at the pass,

56
00:03:40.936 --> 00:03:43.806 A:middle
try to provide some advice
to streamline the process

57
00:03:43.866 --> 00:03:46.046 A:middle
and prevent your apps
from getting rejected.

58
00:03:46.596 --> 00:03:52.066 A:middle
And in order to do that, got
a little ahead on myself,

59
00:03:52.646 --> 00:03:56.046 A:middle
we're going to look at 10
common pitfalls that I see over

60
00:03:56.046 --> 00:03:56.916 A:middle
and over and over again.

61
00:03:56.916 --> 00:04:00.226 A:middle
And the first one
is bad app icons.

62
00:04:00.226 --> 00:04:04.566 A:middle
So this is the first place
that most people are going

63
00:04:04.566 --> 00:04:05.636 A:middle
to encounter your app.

64
00:04:06.936 --> 00:04:09.116 A:middle
They're going to search for
something and your app is going

65
00:04:09.116 --> 00:04:12.346 A:middle
to come up in the results
alongside dozens and dozens

66
00:04:12.346 --> 00:04:15.386 A:middle
of other apps, and you have
to standout from the crowd.

67
00:04:16.296 --> 00:04:17.536 A:middle
This is a search for camera,

68
00:04:17.786 --> 00:04:19.125 A:middle
I just did this couple
of weeks ago.

69
00:04:19.805 --> 00:04:22.156 A:middle
And I bet there're some
icons here that are standing

70
00:04:22.156 --> 00:04:25.626 A:middle
out better than others, that
you noticed first immediately,

71
00:04:25.676 --> 00:04:26.936 A:middle
right when we got to the slide.

72
00:04:27.656 --> 00:04:29.586 A:middle
And that's not unlike
what happens

73
00:04:29.586 --> 00:04:33.206 A:middle
when you did the search yourself
at home on your computer.

74
00:04:34.066 --> 00:04:35.436 A:middle
Things are going to
draw your eye in,

75
00:04:35.966 --> 00:04:40.416 A:middle
and you immediately begin
to make a lot of assumptions

76
00:04:40.796 --> 00:04:44.556 A:middle
about the user experience of
these apps, so you'll look

77
00:04:44.556 --> 00:04:46.906 A:middle
at them and start to
make these inferences

78
00:04:46.906 --> 00:04:49.826 A:middle
about how enjoyable
they're going to be to use,

79
00:04:49.966 --> 00:04:51.716 A:middle
how intuitive the
interface is going to be,

80
00:04:52.276 --> 00:04:54.826 A:middle
how well it's going
to serve your needs.

81
00:04:55.446 --> 00:04:56.546 A:middle
And I think those are kind

82
00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:59.626 A:middle
of reasonable assumptions
actually to make from an icon.

83
00:04:59.626 --> 00:05:01.556 A:middle
I mean, if an icon looks great

84
00:05:01.556 --> 00:05:04.806 A:middle
and it obviously was carefully
crafted, it's reasonable

85
00:05:04.806 --> 00:05:09.146 A:middle
to assume that the rest of the
design of the app is also great

86
00:05:09.396 --> 00:05:10.636 A:middle
and also well crafted.

87
00:05:11.166 --> 00:05:13.316 A:middle
But it goes beyond that.

88
00:05:13.666 --> 00:05:14.866 A:middle
People start to make all sorts

89
00:05:14.866 --> 00:05:16.576 A:middle
of other assumptions
about your app.

90
00:05:18.016 --> 00:05:19.366 A:middle
How good the technology is.

91
00:05:19.886 --> 00:05:21.426 A:middle
How secure your data is.

92
00:05:21.906 --> 00:05:23.216 A:middle
How performant it is.

93
00:05:23.506 --> 00:05:24.366 A:middle
Is it stable?

94
00:05:25.346 --> 00:05:29.146 A:middle
Is it going to have
functionality which is ahead--

95
00:05:29.266 --> 00:05:32.236 A:middle
you know, advanced better
than the competition?

96
00:05:32.806 --> 00:05:35.356 A:middle
So with that in mind,

97
00:05:35.576 --> 00:05:38.526 A:middle
an app icon is really an
important thing to focus on.

98
00:05:39.986 --> 00:05:40.916 A:middle
And what are the qualities

99
00:05:40.916 --> 00:05:43.536 A:middle
that distinguish a
really great app icon?

100
00:05:44.076 --> 00:05:45.506 A:middle
Well, there's two main things.

101
00:05:45.926 --> 00:05:50.326 A:middle
One, it's beautiful and I think
probably more importantly,

102
00:05:50.326 --> 00:05:52.076 A:middle
it's instantly recognizable.

103
00:05:52.666 --> 00:05:56.196 A:middle
So how do you accomplish that?

104
00:05:56.656 --> 00:05:58.646 A:middle
Well, there're six things
that I want to point

105
00:05:58.646 --> 00:06:00.696 A:middle
out that are important
to keep in mind.

106
00:06:00.696 --> 00:06:04.196 A:middle
I think they distinguish
every great app icon.

107
00:06:04.736 --> 00:06:09.336 A:middle
The first, focus
on unique shape.

108
00:06:10.366 --> 00:06:12.746 A:middle
These four icons, they
do different things,

109
00:06:12.746 --> 00:06:16.146 A:middle
some are very simple
or with solid colors,

110
00:06:16.146 --> 00:06:17.326 A:middle
or just a clean gradient.

111
00:06:17.666 --> 00:06:21.206 A:middle
Others are a little bit more
complex but they all start

112
00:06:21.206 --> 00:06:24.106 A:middle
with this very basic
shape, and that allows them

113
00:06:24.106 --> 00:06:26.776 A:middle
to be recognizable
at a great distance.

114
00:06:27.666 --> 00:06:28.476 A:middle
So you guys in the back

115
00:06:28.476 --> 00:06:31.216 A:middle
of the room right now are
having a really easy time making

116
00:06:31.216 --> 00:06:35.386 A:middle
out what the shape of these
icons is, and that's important.

117
00:06:35.996 --> 00:06:37.776 A:middle
Icons are seen at
all different sizes.

118
00:06:37.776 --> 00:06:42.166 A:middle
You know, it's not just the
size you see in the store,

119
00:06:42.336 --> 00:06:44.866 A:middle
it gets smaller on the
home screen and smaller

120
00:06:44.866 --> 00:06:46.076 A:middle
on the notification center

121
00:06:46.076 --> 00:06:47.536 A:middle
and it's really small
inside the groups.

122
00:06:47.536 --> 00:06:50.196 A:middle
So you have to make sure
that the imaging you choose

123
00:06:50.196 --> 00:06:52.366 A:middle
for your app icon is kind
of reduce really well

124
00:06:52.786 --> 00:06:54.416 A:middle
and be clear at any size.

125
00:06:56.616 --> 00:07:00.936 A:middle
The next step is to just
choose a limited pallet,

126
00:07:02.116 --> 00:07:03.936 A:middle
one color, maybe two.

127
00:07:04.846 --> 00:07:07.856 A:middle
Now, there're app icons that
have much more than one color

128
00:07:07.856 --> 00:07:11.296 A:middle
or two but it's really
complicated to pull off right.

129
00:07:11.956 --> 00:07:14.456 A:middle
We'll see an example of it in
a few moments and I'll point it

130
00:07:14.456 --> 00:07:17.186 A:middle
out when we get there,
but notice these icons,

131
00:07:18.196 --> 00:07:21.016 A:middle
just really one color and
it has variations and tone

132
00:07:21.896 --> 00:07:24.766 A:middle
but they stand out,
they're not fragmented.

133
00:07:25.346 --> 00:07:30.316 A:middle
Now, the next one is to
avoid using photography

134
00:07:30.316 --> 00:07:31.246 A:middle
in your app icon.

135
00:07:31.396 --> 00:07:32.796 A:middle
I've seen it a number of times

136
00:07:33.226 --> 00:07:35.816 A:middle
and it never works
out well in the end.

137
00:07:36.676 --> 00:07:39.186 A:middle
So let's take for example,
you're making an app

138
00:07:40.146 --> 00:07:43.496 A:middle
for wine lovers, to take notes
about the wines they like

139
00:07:44.796 --> 00:07:45.866 A:middle
and share with others.

140
00:07:45.866 --> 00:07:49.076 A:middle
So you might be tempted to
start with something like this,

141
00:07:49.846 --> 00:07:53.556 A:middle
nice glass of red wine
and you just crop it,

142
00:07:53.866 --> 00:07:57.446 A:middle
put some rounded corners on
it, throw a gradient over it.

143
00:07:57.996 --> 00:07:59.516 A:middle
Does anyone think
that looks good?

144
00:08:00.096 --> 00:08:01.526 A:middle
Looks terrible.

145
00:08:01.526 --> 00:08:05.716 A:middle
So you-- but, you know,
if you want your icon

146
00:08:05.716 --> 00:08:09.706 A:middle
to have these features, that's
fine, just illustrate it,

147
00:08:09.746 --> 00:08:13.736 A:middle
take it to the next level,
hire a good app icon designer,

148
00:08:14.036 --> 00:08:15.156 A:middle
who can pull this off well.

149
00:08:16.366 --> 00:08:18.696 A:middle
And that's exactly what
the people at Sipp did,

150
00:08:19.736 --> 00:08:23.816 A:middle
hired a really talented
designer named Eddie Lobanovskiy

151
00:08:24.946 --> 00:08:27.686 A:middle
and he made this fantastic
illustration for their app icon.

152
00:08:28.186 --> 00:08:32.626 A:middle
It has the same elements as that
photo, it's got the red wine,

153
00:08:32.936 --> 00:08:35.785 A:middle
it's got the glass, it's
got the wood texture

154
00:08:36.066 --> 00:08:40.956 A:middle
that evokes the barrel, but
the composition is really solid

155
00:08:41.086 --> 00:08:42.826 A:middle
and it's also really creative.

156
00:08:44.006 --> 00:08:50.376 A:middle
And these are two values that we
cherished at Apple, creativity

157
00:08:50.786 --> 00:08:53.186 A:middle
and attention to
detail, and of course,

158
00:08:53.186 --> 00:08:56.976 A:middle
the way that red wine swishes
around and forms the letter S,

159
00:08:57.476 --> 00:09:03.826 A:middle
the mnemonic device to
connect with the app name.

160
00:09:04.036 --> 00:09:06.596 A:middle
All right, so the next one
is avoid a lot of text.

161
00:09:07.386 --> 00:09:10.306 A:middle
In fact, if you can get
away with having no text,

162
00:09:10.576 --> 00:09:12.406 A:middle
that's probably the
right thing to do.

163
00:09:13.226 --> 00:09:16.926 A:middle
So, let's take a made-up
example to illustrate a point.

164
00:09:17.506 --> 00:09:20.606 A:middle
This is for a fictitious
hair salon and make

165
00:09:20.606 --> 00:09:21.886 A:middle
up studio called Fuzz.

166
00:09:22.706 --> 00:09:25.026 A:middle
Now, you can have
an icon that's--

167
00:09:25.086 --> 00:09:28.396 A:middle
a logo that's this complicated
and it might work really well

168
00:09:28.396 --> 00:09:32.186 A:middle
in website or in marketing
collateral, on a billboard,

169
00:09:32.186 --> 00:09:35.576 A:middle
but when you reduce it
down to use as app icon,

170
00:09:36.106 --> 00:09:39.296 A:middle
it starts to break down
very quickly especially

171
00:09:39.616 --> 00:09:42.936 A:middle
when you start to think
about all the smaller sizes

172
00:09:43.006 --> 00:09:44.116 A:middle
that people are going see then.

173
00:09:44.706 --> 00:09:47.816 A:middle
So that was a fake example.

174
00:09:48.796 --> 00:09:50.296 A:middle
Let's take a more real example.

175
00:09:50.526 --> 00:09:52.546 A:middle
A lot of you guys use this app.

176
00:09:52.686 --> 00:09:55.106 A:middle
It's a great app,
ness, you can use it

177
00:09:55.106 --> 00:09:56.976 A:middle
to find restaurant
recommendations

178
00:09:56.976 --> 00:09:59.346 A:middle
and they have very customized
personal profile based

179
00:09:59.346 --> 00:10:00.666 A:middle
on your own preferences.

180
00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:05.196 A:middle
And they have a really fantastic
logo that's actually really

181
00:10:05.196 --> 00:10:07.536 A:middle
simple, not nearly
as complicated

182
00:10:07.536 --> 00:10:08.716 A:middle
as what we just looked
at before.

183
00:10:09.286 --> 00:10:13.906 A:middle
And they could've maybe just
taken that and reduced it

184
00:10:13.906 --> 00:10:15.296 A:middle
and used it as an app icon.

185
00:10:16.526 --> 00:10:17.986 A:middle
But that wouldn't
have been good enough.

186
00:10:18.586 --> 00:10:21.596 A:middle
What they chose to do
instead was to pull

187
00:10:21.596 --> 00:10:24.326 A:middle
out just the heart and use that.

188
00:10:25.246 --> 00:10:26.906 A:middle
It's a really simply shape.

189
00:10:26.936 --> 00:10:28.736 A:middle
Now I was going to call this

190
00:10:28.736 --> 00:10:30.896 A:middle
out when I was talking
multiple colors,

191
00:10:31.076 --> 00:10:33.036 A:middle
and you can see there
are multiple colors here

192
00:10:33.446 --> 00:10:36.876 A:middle
but the composition of the heart
really holds that altogether.

193
00:10:37.886 --> 00:10:41.116 A:middle
So even at small
sizes, it works well.

194
00:10:41.926 --> 00:10:44.816 A:middle
I've had this app on my
phone for a number of months

195
00:10:45.426 --> 00:10:49.706 A:middle
and it always catches my
attention, it really stands out.

196
00:10:51.236 --> 00:10:52.996 A:middle
In fact, you see a lot

197
00:10:52.996 --> 00:10:54.746 A:middle
of companies doing
this sort of thing.

198
00:10:55.636 --> 00:10:59.226 A:middle
So for example, Pocket, they
have that little pocket icon

199
00:10:59.556 --> 00:11:02.916 A:middle
with the down arrow and they
use that as their app icon,

200
00:11:02.916 --> 00:11:05.016 A:middle
it works really well,
or Pinterest

201
00:11:05.016 --> 00:11:09.956 A:middle
with their P that's kind of
like an abstract pin or the S

202
00:11:09.956 --> 00:11:13.646 A:middle
for Snapguide and
the V for Vine,

203
00:11:14.316 --> 00:11:15.316 A:middle
there's some patterns here.

204
00:11:16.056 --> 00:11:18.266 A:middle
But the reason why
there's this pattern is

205
00:11:18.266 --> 00:11:20.136 A:middle
because this works really well.

206
00:11:20.846 --> 00:11:23.546 A:middle
Now, of course, they bring in
the color from their brands

207
00:11:23.866 --> 00:11:26.236 A:middle
to give it some unique
personality

208
00:11:27.076 --> 00:11:32.096 A:middle
and they work well
on the home screen.

209
00:11:32.206 --> 00:11:36.306 A:middle
Alright, next up,
accurately portray materials.

210
00:11:36.306 --> 00:11:41.046 A:middle
Now this might be a little
bit surprising given some

211
00:11:41.176 --> 00:11:43.466 A:middle
of the changes that
have taken place,

212
00:11:44.536 --> 00:11:47.026 A:middle
but sometimes materials
are really important

213
00:11:47.026 --> 00:11:48.036 A:middle
for your app icon.

214
00:11:48.846 --> 00:11:51.926 A:middle
App icon is the ability
to be expressive

215
00:11:52.556 --> 00:11:56.986 A:middle
to demonstrate your unique value
and personality of your app.

216
00:11:57.616 --> 00:11:58.936 A:middle
So let's look at Paper.

217
00:11:58.936 --> 00:12:01.876 A:middle
I mean, the name of
the product is Paper.

218
00:12:01.876 --> 00:12:05.426 A:middle
So it would be sort of odd
if your icon didn't look

219
00:12:05.426 --> 00:12:06.786 A:middle
like it was made from paper.

220
00:12:07.586 --> 00:12:11.146 A:middle
Paper is this brilliant
drawing and painting tool

221
00:12:11.186 --> 00:12:14.896 A:middle
which won an ADA last year and
it's got these amazing brushes

222
00:12:14.896 --> 00:12:17.776 A:middle
and you can-- anything you draw
is going to look beautiful.

223
00:12:18.386 --> 00:12:21.356 A:middle
And so, they demonstrate
that by these careful washes,

224
00:12:21.706 --> 00:12:25.626 A:middle
the watercolor layered
on top of layer of color.

225
00:12:25.686 --> 00:12:29.166 A:middle
They have the crease of
the paper which connects

226
00:12:29.246 --> 00:12:32.866 A:middle
to the journals that you
see inside of application.

227
00:12:33.696 --> 00:12:34.756 A:middle
It's a really nice icon.

228
00:12:35.326 --> 00:12:38.536 A:middle
And this icon, from
Square Wallet,

229
00:12:39.576 --> 00:12:41.406 A:middle
it's kind of that hologram
thing that you used

230
00:12:41.476 --> 00:12:42.346 A:middle
to see in credit cards.

231
00:12:42.346 --> 00:12:46.886 A:middle
I don't know if they still have
them but this is beautiful.

232
00:12:47.456 --> 00:12:49.736 A:middle
And I know it has
a lot of colors

233
00:12:49.736 --> 00:12:53.786 A:middle
but it has an overall color
of the sort of cool blue tone

234
00:12:54.666 --> 00:12:56.646 A:middle
and it's got a really
distinct shape,

235
00:12:56.646 --> 00:12:58.756 A:middle
it's got these concentric
squares

236
00:12:59.416 --> 00:13:02.276 A:middle
so just it pops really well,
it's easy to make this out.

237
00:13:03.606 --> 00:13:05.656 A:middle
If you're going to go
for a texture like this,

238
00:13:05.856 --> 00:13:08.826 A:middle
this holographic paper,
you really want to sell it,

239
00:13:09.026 --> 00:13:11.076 A:middle
you really want to nail it,
and this icon does that.

240
00:13:12.526 --> 00:13:14.426 A:middle
Now, this icon from 1Password

241
00:13:14.426 --> 00:13:17.956 A:middle
and 1Password stores
all your passwords,

242
00:13:18.296 --> 00:13:20.196 A:middle
obviously that's pretty
sensitive information

243
00:13:20.506 --> 00:13:23.186 A:middle
so you want to get a sense
that that data is secure,

244
00:13:23.186 --> 00:13:27.636 A:middle
and this icon conveys that
by looking like a lock or--

245
00:13:27.806 --> 00:13:31.616 A:middle
sorry, a safe, you
know, it feels strong,

246
00:13:31.616 --> 00:13:32.746 A:middle
it feels impenetrable.

247
00:13:33.136 --> 00:13:36.686 A:middle
So, it's communicating
these emotional reactions

248
00:13:37.516 --> 00:13:40.286 A:middle
or it's eliciting these
emotional reactions in us

249
00:13:40.596 --> 00:13:43.626 A:middle
and we see it and that's why
they use these materials.

250
00:13:44.106 --> 00:13:46.966 A:middle
But, again, it's
really realistic.

251
00:13:47.466 --> 00:13:52.256 A:middle
And finally, I came across
this icon when I was looking

252
00:13:52.306 --> 00:13:53.946 A:middle
for some examples
to show you guys,

253
00:13:54.426 --> 00:13:57.186 A:middle
and this is for an
app called LifeKraze,

254
00:13:57.746 --> 00:13:58.946 A:middle
it's kind of a cool app.

255
00:13:59.196 --> 00:14:02.986 A:middle
You set some personal goals and
then you have a team of people

256
00:14:03.396 --> 00:14:05.806 A:middle
who are in your social
network and they cheer you on

257
00:14:05.996 --> 00:14:07.346 A:middle
and in turn, you cheer them on.

258
00:14:07.976 --> 00:14:09.906 A:middle
And I didn't a get a chance
to confirm this with them

259
00:14:09.906 --> 00:14:12.586 A:middle
but my interpretation of this
is that it's meant to be kind

260
00:14:12.586 --> 00:14:13.656 A:middle
of like a team Jersey

261
00:14:14.016 --> 00:14:16.746 A:middle
or sponsorship kind
of thing, embroidery.

262
00:14:18.016 --> 00:14:21.116 A:middle
But look how amazing
this icon is.

263
00:14:22.486 --> 00:14:26.236 A:middle
I mean, the texture of the
string, the embroidery,

264
00:14:27.736 --> 00:14:30.166 A:middle
I'm not even sure
how they made this.

265
00:14:31.406 --> 00:14:33.276 A:middle
[laughter] I've been at
this for a really long time.

266
00:14:34.296 --> 00:14:36.976 A:middle
I want to go out there and
figure out their trick.

267
00:14:37.586 --> 00:14:39.576 A:middle
So this is brilliant.

268
00:14:40.396 --> 00:14:43.246 A:middle
Again, this is highest
level of artistry.

269
00:14:43.756 --> 00:14:47.866 A:middle
And finally, be creative.

270
00:14:47.916 --> 00:14:49.326 A:middle
I can't emphasize this enough.

271
00:14:49.736 --> 00:14:52.156 A:middle
You try to stand out from
the crowd, you're trying

272
00:14:52.156 --> 00:14:53.336 A:middle
to stand out from the rest.

273
00:14:54.126 --> 00:14:56.756 A:middle
So take for example this icon
for an app called Routesy,

274
00:14:56.756 --> 00:14:57.996 A:middle
it gives you information

275
00:14:57.996 --> 00:15:02.226 A:middle
about local Muni Transit
timetables and such.

276
00:15:02.766 --> 00:15:05.146 A:middle
This looks like the
old Muni Passes.

277
00:15:05.986 --> 00:15:09.576 A:middle
It's really nice,
it looks pretty.

278
00:15:09.736 --> 00:15:11.006 A:middle
This icon from Hipstamatic.

279
00:15:12.576 --> 00:15:15.516 A:middle
You guys are familiar with this?

280
00:15:15.726 --> 00:15:16.836 A:middle
Or Evernote Food?

281
00:15:18.176 --> 00:15:21.456 A:middle
Or this icon for Brewski Me.

282
00:15:22.446 --> 00:15:25.596 A:middle
I mean, look at the
perspiration on the glass,

283
00:15:26.306 --> 00:15:29.096 A:middle
in a way that frothy
head foam is

284
00:15:29.096 --> 00:15:30.806 A:middle
about to just fall
over the edge.

285
00:15:31.226 --> 00:15:32.106 A:middle
It's really dynamic.

286
00:15:32.226 --> 00:15:34.666 A:middle
It has a lot of good
characteristics

287
00:15:35.196 --> 00:15:36.756 A:middle
that we look for
in illustration.

288
00:15:38.116 --> 00:15:41.136 A:middle
And yet, while this is a
really complicated rendering,

289
00:15:41.916 --> 00:15:44.596 A:middle
it's actually kind of simple
and when you pull back from it,

290
00:15:44.816 --> 00:15:48.246 A:middle
you see it's just a big area
of yellow color in the center

291
00:15:48.246 --> 00:15:51.046 A:middle
with a nice white outline,
stands out really well

292
00:15:51.046 --> 00:15:52.236 A:middle
from multiple backgrounds.

293
00:15:53.836 --> 00:15:54.806 A:middle
Anyone thirsty?

294
00:15:55.016 --> 00:15:56.536 A:middle
I became a little thirsty.

295
00:15:57.166 --> 00:16:00.536 A:middle
So these are really
creative icons.

296
00:16:01.816 --> 00:16:05.066 A:middle
Now, we'd looked at a range
of icons and I'm going

297
00:16:05.936 --> 00:16:08.646 A:middle
to show you all the way
for a new phone icon.

298
00:16:08.646 --> 00:16:10.706 A:middle
It couldn't be more simple.

299
00:16:11.176 --> 00:16:14.616 A:middle
Just a simple shape and a
gradient up to something

300
00:16:14.616 --> 00:16:19.856 A:middle
which is a little bit more
complicated all the way

301
00:16:19.856 --> 00:16:22.436 A:middle
to something which is this
really detailed illustration

302
00:16:22.436 --> 00:16:22.886 A:middle
for Sip.

303
00:16:22.886 --> 00:16:26.986 A:middle
And these are all valid
approaches to designing icons.

304
00:16:28.156 --> 00:16:30.956 A:middle
They work well for their
respective products.

305
00:16:30.956 --> 00:16:36.176 A:middle
Alright, next bit of
advice, please make sure

306
00:16:36.176 --> 00:16:39.016 A:middle
to check your icon against
multiple backgrounds.

307
00:16:39.646 --> 00:16:43.526 A:middle
It's really tempting, a lot
easier, in fact, to just test it

308
00:16:43.526 --> 00:16:44.886 A:middle
against a black background.

309
00:16:45.266 --> 00:16:48.286 A:middle
But a lot of times, you can't--
you have to account for the fact

310
00:16:48.286 --> 00:16:51.066 A:middle
that these icons are going to
show up against who knows what.

311
00:16:52.086 --> 00:16:56.556 A:middle
And also, put your icons into
a group and then collapse

312
00:16:56.556 --> 00:16:59.406 A:middle
that group and evaluate
how well it's working.

313
00:16:59.986 --> 00:17:06.086 A:middle
So, I'm going to show you
really a cool case study.

314
00:17:06.766 --> 00:17:09.266 A:middle
This is for an app
called Turnplay

315
00:17:10.566 --> 00:17:13.356 A:middle
and the design work was done
by a company called Ramotion

316
00:17:13.566 --> 00:17:17.576 A:middle
and what Turnplay is, is this
fun little app that allows you

317
00:17:17.576 --> 00:17:20.445 A:middle
to play your MP3 files,
whatever your music files

318
00:17:20.826 --> 00:17:21.925 A:middle
as though they were vinyl,

319
00:17:23.316 --> 00:17:26.195 A:middle
and that's the whole
sum of this app.

320
00:17:26.266 --> 00:17:28.296 A:middle
That's what it does and
that what makes it unique

321
00:17:28.296 --> 00:17:29.096 A:middle
and special.

322
00:17:30.976 --> 00:17:32.876 A:middle
So even when you
select your songs,

323
00:17:32.926 --> 00:17:34.616 A:middle
they have the sleeves
for the vinyl.

324
00:17:35.556 --> 00:17:37.696 A:middle
And then this is the turntable
interface that you see

325
00:17:37.696 --> 00:17:38.696 A:middle
when you're playing a record.

326
00:17:38.696 --> 00:17:40.716 A:middle
This is not a photo.

327
00:17:41.496 --> 00:17:44.346 A:middle
Every pixel here was hand-drawn

328
00:17:45.146 --> 00:17:47.006 A:middle
in Illustrator then
in Photoshop.

329
00:17:47.006 --> 00:17:50.626 A:middle
I mean, this is an exquisite
rendering of a turntable.

330
00:17:51.246 --> 00:17:55.626 A:middle
So when it came time for
them to make an app icon,

331
00:17:55.626 --> 00:17:57.786 A:middle
they knew they needed to connect
to those characteristics.

332
00:17:58.166 --> 00:18:01.306 A:middle
They knew they needed to
demonstrate the beauty

333
00:18:01.306 --> 00:18:03.426 A:middle
of that turntable
interface but they also had

334
00:18:03.426 --> 00:18:05.136 A:middle
to get the symbolism
of the icon right,

335
00:18:06.396 --> 00:18:09.176 A:middle
and so Ramotion started
with sketches.

336
00:18:09.176 --> 00:18:11.756 A:middle
Now, there's a lot of different
approaches to making icons.

337
00:18:12.986 --> 00:18:15.246 A:middle
You could start in a 3D
rendering tool, you can start

338
00:18:15.246 --> 00:18:17.476 A:middle
in Photoshop, you can
do whiteboard drawings.

339
00:18:17.866 --> 00:18:20.526 A:middle
In fact, that's-- my team
used to do a lot of it

340
00:18:20.526 --> 00:18:23.566 A:middle
when we started app
icons for Apple products.

341
00:18:24.296 --> 00:18:27.276 A:middle
But they started with paper
sketches and the team set

342
00:18:27.276 --> 00:18:29.006 A:middle
out to work out all
these different ideas.

343
00:18:29.846 --> 00:18:30.526 A:middle
And as you could see,

344
00:18:30.526 --> 00:18:32.226 A:middle
they explored a lot
of different things.

345
00:18:32.576 --> 00:18:36.916 A:middle
All these of icons have a
vinyl record at the heart of it

346
00:18:37.346 --> 00:18:39.336 A:middle
but then they tried
different compositions,

347
00:18:39.716 --> 00:18:43.356 A:middle
adding different elements,
you can see the hands here,

348
00:18:44.176 --> 00:18:47.456 A:middle
the styluses, different
orientations,

349
00:18:47.456 --> 00:18:50.496 A:middle
a lot of them are top-down but
this one second from the right,

350
00:18:50.496 --> 00:18:52.416 A:middle
is at a 45-degree angle,

351
00:18:52.596 --> 00:18:54.846 A:middle
and sometimes the record is
floating above the platter.

352
00:18:55.306 --> 00:18:57.956 A:middle
Sometimes, there's a-- the hint
of an audience in the background

353
00:18:58.356 --> 00:19:00.076 A:middle
or the dot pattern
from the platter

354
00:19:00.076 --> 00:19:02.466 A:middle
to tell you what tempo you're
playing your record at.

355
00:19:03.526 --> 00:19:05.106 A:middle
It's really antiquated
technology.

356
00:19:05.106 --> 00:19:09.356 A:middle
How many people have
heard of a turntable?

357
00:19:09.356 --> 00:19:12.266 A:middle
So, they tried all
these different things.

358
00:19:12.816 --> 00:19:15.016 A:middle
They even tried to do what
we were looking at before,

359
00:19:15.016 --> 00:19:18.236 A:middle
which is to take the first
letter of their app name, the T,

360
00:19:18.236 --> 00:19:21.176 A:middle
and integrate that into
the design, and they came

361
00:19:21.176 --> 00:19:25.086 A:middle
up with some pretty interesting
ideas on how to accomplish that.

362
00:19:26.156 --> 00:19:29.186 A:middle
By starting with sketches,
you're not thinking about color,

363
00:19:29.226 --> 00:19:31.826 A:middle
you're not thinking about
materials, you're thinking

364
00:19:31.826 --> 00:19:34.536 A:middle
about the core element
of the illustration

365
00:19:34.816 --> 00:19:36.146 A:middle
which is the composition.

366
00:19:36.416 --> 00:19:39.456 A:middle
It's really important that
your composition is solid.

367
00:19:40.786 --> 00:19:43.456 A:middle
So they kept going, tried out--

368
00:19:43.456 --> 00:19:45.896 A:middle
I don't know what the
fingerprints thing is.

369
00:19:45.896 --> 00:19:47.306 A:middle
I know you get fingerprints
on vinyl.

370
00:19:47.916 --> 00:19:52.046 A:middle
I'm glad they didn't
go down that route.

371
00:19:52.116 --> 00:19:54.356 A:middle
And finally, they started to
kind of lock in what they wanted

372
00:19:54.356 --> 00:20:01.256 A:middle
to do and eventually,
they got to this.

373
00:20:01.476 --> 00:20:03.316 A:middle
Really simple, right?

374
00:20:05.756 --> 00:20:10.826 A:middle
Turntable, play, and you can
see they started to think, "Oh,

375
00:20:10.826 --> 00:20:13.556 A:middle
we're going to have this play
icon in here" but it's going

376
00:20:13.556 --> 00:20:16.586 A:middle
to be like this little sticky
label that goes on the record.

377
00:20:17.126 --> 00:20:20.126 A:middle
But these are concentric shapes.

378
00:20:20.376 --> 00:20:21.356 A:middle
They're really powerful.

379
00:20:21.836 --> 00:20:25.036 A:middle
This is a strong form
in and of itself.

380
00:20:25.436 --> 00:20:31.146 A:middle
Only from-- only when they
had that did they to start add

381
00:20:31.146 --> 00:20:32.266 A:middle
in some of the detail.

382
00:20:32.566 --> 00:20:34.186 A:middle
They started to add
in gradients.

383
00:20:34.736 --> 00:20:36.736 A:middle
They added in the dot
pattern around the platter

384
00:20:36.736 --> 00:20:38.786 A:middle
but they didn't make
it totally accurate

385
00:20:38.786 --> 00:20:39.616 A:middle
because that would
have been a mess.

386
00:20:39.826 --> 00:20:41.646 A:middle
I mean, it just would have
been too much detail to work

387
00:20:41.646 --> 00:20:44.306 A:middle
at any size, even 1024 square.

388
00:20:44.846 --> 00:20:49.746 A:middle
They kept adding in a
detail, adding in detail.

389
00:20:50.896 --> 00:20:55.066 A:middle
They gave that play icon that
papery texture so really knew

390
00:20:55.066 --> 00:20:56.206 A:middle
that it was supposed
to be paper.

391
00:20:57.696 --> 00:20:59.026 A:middle
Shading, highlight.

392
00:20:59.956 --> 00:21:02.766 A:middle
With each successive
version, it really started

393
00:21:02.766 --> 00:21:04.196 A:middle
to come together more and more.

394
00:21:04.596 --> 00:21:07.676 A:middle
But never losing sight
of that basic shape

395
00:21:09.016 --> 00:21:16.786 A:middle
that they had started with,
and it works well at all sizes

396
00:21:17.876 --> 00:21:21.486 A:middle
because they stuck to that,
they stuck to that basic shape.

397
00:21:21.926 --> 00:21:25.936 A:middle
Alright, so that was a
lot of stuff on icons

398
00:21:26.286 --> 00:21:28.976 A:middle
but it's probably the most
important thing to get right

399
00:21:28.976 --> 00:21:30.326 A:middle
when it comes to visual design.

400
00:21:30.906 --> 00:21:32.906 A:middle
Let's move on.

401
00:21:33.226 --> 00:21:38.116 A:middle
This is Forced Registration,
and for the example,

402
00:21:38.526 --> 00:21:40.126 A:middle
this actually was
shown last year.

403
00:21:40.516 --> 00:21:44.776 A:middle
But a lot of apps do
this kind of thing

404
00:21:44.856 --> 00:21:46.356 A:middle
where they give you two options.

405
00:21:46.356 --> 00:21:49.486 A:middle
You open the app and they
ask you to sign up or sign in

406
00:21:49.486 --> 00:21:53.816 A:middle
and a lot of people hit the Home
button and delete the app icon.

407
00:21:54.236 --> 00:21:59.356 A:middle
People hate this which is
why it's mind-boggling to me

408
00:21:59.566 --> 00:22:01.486 A:middle
that it still happens,
but it still does.

409
00:22:02.316 --> 00:22:03.576 A:middle
So let's look at a case study.

410
00:22:04.106 --> 00:22:06.826 A:middle
This was an app called Fondu.

411
00:22:07.066 --> 00:22:09.176 A:middle
They used to be in App
Store, they're not anymore,

412
00:22:09.356 --> 00:22:12.416 A:middle
they've been acquired by Airbnb.

413
00:22:12.926 --> 00:22:13.906 A:middle
So all the stuff
I'm going to show

414
00:22:13.906 --> 00:22:16.316 A:middle
that they did obviously was
very successful for them,

415
00:22:16.766 --> 00:22:19.056 A:middle
but they used to
make you sign up.

416
00:22:19.056 --> 00:22:22.076 A:middle
It's a social networking
food app.

417
00:22:23.596 --> 00:22:27.356 A:middle
And they realized that
weren't getting the uptake

418
00:22:27.686 --> 00:22:29.416 A:middle
in people signing
up and registering

419
00:22:30.646 --> 00:22:32.286 A:middle
because they would
just do what I said,

420
00:22:32.286 --> 00:22:33.936 A:middle
they would leave right away.

421
00:22:34.136 --> 00:22:35.446 A:middle
They didn't know the
value of the app.

422
00:22:36.156 --> 00:22:39.476 A:middle
So instead, they completely went
away and redesigned their app

423
00:22:40.096 --> 00:22:42.136 A:middle
to show a few screens
right off the bat,

424
00:22:42.496 --> 00:22:45.306 A:middle
where you can see
something about the features

425
00:22:45.306 --> 00:22:47.686 A:middle
and understand what
purpose this product serves,

426
00:22:48.526 --> 00:22:53.146 A:middle
and only when you got to the end
of it where you given the choice

427
00:22:53.216 --> 00:22:54.906 A:middle
to sign up or to sign in.

428
00:22:55.816 --> 00:23:01.026 A:middle
But even with that, they
allowed a third choice which was

429
00:23:01.066 --> 00:23:03.636 A:middle
to continue forward
and get a taste--

430
00:23:03.636 --> 00:23:05.626 A:middle
this is a nice little
bit of copy--

431
00:23:06.516 --> 00:23:09.806 A:middle
and you can use public
features of the app,

432
00:23:10.506 --> 00:23:12.136 A:middle
and so you really
would get a sense

433
00:23:12.136 --> 00:23:15.596 A:middle
for why this app had value,
what was interesting about it.

434
00:23:16.316 --> 00:23:19.556 A:middle
And I recommend that if
you're in a similar situation,

435
00:23:19.556 --> 00:23:20.686 A:middle
you should do the same thing.

436
00:23:21.526 --> 00:23:23.786 A:middle
You want to allow people
to try before they buy.

437
00:23:27.996 --> 00:23:30.786 A:middle
As a result, they had
a 42 percent increase

438
00:23:30.786 --> 00:23:33.996 A:middle
in registration shortly after
they made these design changes.

439
00:23:34.506 --> 00:23:36.246 A:middle
As we talked about, they
eventually got acquired,

440
00:23:36.536 --> 00:23:38.916 A:middle
so do what they did
and allow people

441
00:23:38.916 --> 00:23:40.796 A:middle
to use your product
rather than forcing them

442
00:23:40.796 --> 00:23:41.976 A:middle
to registrater right
off the bat.

443
00:23:42.436 --> 00:23:46.146 A:middle
All right, so that was
forced registration.

444
00:23:47.566 --> 00:23:49.886 A:middle
The next pitfall
is Tiny Controls.

445
00:23:50.986 --> 00:23:54.096 A:middle
Now, this is how we could
have designed the WWDC app.

446
00:23:54.096 --> 00:23:56.916 A:middle
We could have made text smaller,

447
00:23:56.916 --> 00:23:59.746 A:middle
we could have made the rows
smaller, little date switcher

448
00:23:59.746 --> 00:24:03.956 A:middle
at the top, all the buttons
and the nav bar, but instead,

449
00:24:03.956 --> 00:24:05.206 A:middle
this is what we actually
shipped.

450
00:24:06.606 --> 00:24:08.716 A:middle
Things are-- have
normal metrics,

451
00:24:08.716 --> 00:24:10.166 A:middle
they're a lot easier to tap.

452
00:24:10.926 --> 00:24:15.686 A:middle
If you have greater density
and really small tap targets,

453
00:24:16.096 --> 00:24:18.296 A:middle
it's hard to aim
so that slows you

454
00:24:18.296 --> 00:24:20.996 A:middle
down as you're pointing your
finger towards the screen,

455
00:24:20.996 --> 00:24:22.776 A:middle
it makes you more conscious
of what you're doing.

456
00:24:23.146 --> 00:24:25.976 A:middle
So while you might see more
stuff on screen at one time,

457
00:24:26.336 --> 00:24:27.916 A:middle
your app becomes harder to use.

458
00:24:27.916 --> 00:24:32.326 A:middle
It's much easier when you have
really easy to tap targets.

459
00:24:32.326 --> 00:24:36.776 A:middle
You have to design your
products for a fingertip.

460
00:24:37.736 --> 00:24:39.586 A:middle
I'm surprised when
I see some apps

461
00:24:39.646 --> 00:24:42.406 A:middle
that have these really
small tap targets and things

462
00:24:42.406 --> 00:24:43.406 A:middle
that are crammed together.

463
00:24:43.406 --> 00:24:49.236 A:middle
It looks like it was designed
for someone who has a cursor.

464
00:24:49.426 --> 00:24:53.016 A:middle
So as you'll see, if you might
read on the HIG, we recommend

465
00:24:53.046 --> 00:24:57.966 A:middle
that controls are 44 points
tall, and you'll see that over

466
00:24:57.966 --> 00:25:00.726 A:middle
and over again in the
controls that we have.

467
00:25:01.726 --> 00:25:07.726 A:middle
Now, this number, 44 points,
this goes back, this isn't new

468
00:25:07.726 --> 00:25:10.706 A:middle
to iOS 7 even though I'm showing
an iOS 7 screen right here.

469
00:25:11.216 --> 00:25:14.466 A:middle
The metrics for a lot of our
controls have stayed the same

470
00:25:15.256 --> 00:25:18.836 A:middle
because the size of our
fingers have stayed the same.

471
00:25:19.996 --> 00:25:21.786 A:middle
So you'll see it
over and over again.

472
00:25:22.116 --> 00:25:25.896 A:middle
Nav bar 44 points,
toolbar 44 points.

473
00:25:26.226 --> 00:25:30.656 A:middle
Even the little callout
for the map is 44 points.

474
00:25:33.556 --> 00:25:38.266 A:middle
Now, if you have additional
space like we did for calendar

475
00:25:38.266 --> 00:25:41.056 A:middle
in iOS 6, make your
controls bigger,

476
00:25:41.716 --> 00:25:44.866 A:middle
it just makes them
easier to tap.

477
00:25:45.046 --> 00:25:46.846 A:middle
And we've updated calculator

478
00:25:47.666 --> 00:25:49.996 A:middle
and now these controls
are bigger still,

479
00:25:51.266 --> 00:25:55.366 A:middle
so they're even easier to tap.

480
00:25:55.556 --> 00:25:58.516 A:middle
And some apps you use
when you're moving around.

481
00:25:58.886 --> 00:26:02.676 A:middle
This is a Cycling app by Strava,
it allows you track your ride

482
00:26:02.676 --> 00:26:06.476 A:middle
through GPS, and you
want to be able to start

483
00:26:06.476 --> 00:26:09.346 A:middle
and stop this while
you're on your bike

484
00:26:09.576 --> 00:26:10.606 A:middle
and while you're moving.

485
00:26:11.166 --> 00:26:12.986 A:middle
So this button that
they have for doing

486
00:26:12.986 --> 00:26:15.496 A:middle
that is 120 points in diameter.

487
00:26:15.586 --> 00:26:16.706 A:middle
It's really easy to tap.

488
00:26:16.706 --> 00:26:19.856 A:middle
I wouldn't be surprised actually
if the tap area is bigger

489
00:26:19.856 --> 00:26:22.856 A:middle
than the size of the button.

490
00:26:22.996 --> 00:26:25.536 A:middle
And lastly, when you're
evaluating whether

491
00:26:25.536 --> 00:26:30.906 A:middle
or not a control is large
enough, test it on your device.

492
00:26:32.416 --> 00:26:34.076 A:middle
There's no substitute for that,

493
00:26:34.346 --> 00:26:36.886 A:middle
you can't make this decision
just sitting at your desk

494
00:26:37.546 --> 00:26:39.036 A:middle
and tapping the interface
of the phone.

495
00:26:39.626 --> 00:26:42.806 A:middle
Go outside, walk around,
use it as an opportunity

496
00:26:43.056 --> 00:26:46.676 A:middle
to do something healthy, stretch
your legs, get some fresh air,

497
00:26:46.676 --> 00:26:51.346 A:middle
give your eyes a break, maybe
hold a cup of coffee in one hand

498
00:26:51.346 --> 00:26:54.336 A:middle
and try to use your phone, and
see how that works for you.

499
00:26:55.076 --> 00:26:56.456 A:middle
Think it'll be educational.

500
00:26:56.456 --> 00:27:02.626 A:middle
All right, the next common
pitfall is Hard-to-Read Text.

501
00:27:03.666 --> 00:27:06.996 A:middle
Now, this is how our WWDC
app could have looked

502
00:27:07.836 --> 00:27:09.976 A:middle
if we were cruel and insane.

503
00:27:12.106 --> 00:27:15.686 A:middle
[laughter] But why is
text hard to read here?

504
00:27:15.686 --> 00:27:19.016 A:middle
Well, it's hard to read because
the colors are too saturated,

505
00:27:19.016 --> 00:27:19.846 A:middle
they're too bright.

506
00:27:20.506 --> 00:27:27.996 A:middle
The font that I chose, it's not
bad per se, but it doesn't work

507
00:27:27.996 --> 00:27:30.026 A:middle
at a small size,
that script font,

508
00:27:30.506 --> 00:27:32.776 A:middle
it's way too small,
can't make that out.

509
00:27:33.246 --> 00:27:37.406 A:middle
This would have really
stoked the rumor mills

510
00:27:37.406 --> 00:27:39.316 A:middle
about the new design of iOS 7.

511
00:27:40.686 --> 00:27:42.846 A:middle
[laughter] We probably
should have done it.

512
00:27:43.896 --> 00:27:46.456 A:middle
So this is something a little
bit more plausible, right?

513
00:27:46.456 --> 00:27:49.056 A:middle
I see some stuff more like
this on a common basis

514
00:27:50.146 --> 00:27:52.396 A:middle
and the problem is
just low contrast.

515
00:27:53.016 --> 00:27:55.876 A:middle
A good metric to use is that
the contrast between text

516
00:27:55.876 --> 00:27:58.516 A:middle
and background should
be at least 50 percent,

517
00:27:59.426 --> 00:28:03.556 A:middle
maybe 60 percent in brightness
which is kind of a hard thing

518
00:28:03.556 --> 00:28:06.116 A:middle
when you're talking about
different colors like red

519
00:28:06.116 --> 00:28:08.576 A:middle
against yellow or something
like that but if you were

520
00:28:08.776 --> 00:28:12.296 A:middle
to desaturate your image and
then measure the colors of gray,

521
00:28:12.596 --> 00:28:15.966 A:middle
that's the kind of delta you
want between the color values.

522
00:28:16.506 --> 00:28:20.126 A:middle
So this is the actual
design for the WWDC app

523
00:28:20.936 --> 00:28:23.736 A:middle
and you can see here the
text is basically black

524
00:28:24.086 --> 00:28:26.726 A:middle
and the background is
almost totally white.

525
00:28:27.316 --> 00:28:29.776 A:middle
So it's really easy to
read and, of course,

526
00:28:29.806 --> 00:28:32.236 A:middle
the fonts are a nice,
legible size.

527
00:28:35.096 --> 00:28:39.546 A:middle
On Wednesday, I talked about
this screen in the context

528
00:28:40.306 --> 00:28:45.356 A:middle
of type and I want to bring it
up again because for one thing,

529
00:28:46.126 --> 00:28:49.456 A:middle
while there's a lot of different
sizes of type and weights

530
00:28:49.456 --> 00:28:52.936 A:middle
of type, which is really
important for establishing,

531
00:28:52.996 --> 00:28:54.946 A:middle
communicating information
hierarchy,

532
00:28:55.346 --> 00:28:57.536 A:middle
calling out which things are
more important than others,

533
00:28:58.716 --> 00:29:00.666 A:middle
it's all the same typeface.

534
00:29:01.556 --> 00:29:06.226 A:middle
And that adds to a sense of
coherency, it all fits together.

535
00:29:06.226 --> 00:29:08.296 A:middle
We didn't just throw
a script font in here.

536
00:29:08.936 --> 00:29:10.966 A:middle
Now, I really recommend
that you do the same thing.

537
00:29:11.486 --> 00:29:13.066 A:middle
You can mix and match typefaces,

538
00:29:13.436 --> 00:29:15.606 A:middle
that's actually an extremely
difficult thing to do.

539
00:29:16.126 --> 00:29:18.556 A:middle
I don't do it 'cause
I don't think--

540
00:29:18.556 --> 00:29:21.296 A:middle
I usually don't think
it's very successful.

541
00:29:21.296 --> 00:29:22.596 A:middle
I don't know how to
pull it off very well.

542
00:29:23.166 --> 00:29:28.496 A:middle
So we have all these different
styles of type and again,

543
00:29:28.496 --> 00:29:31.896 A:middle
another plug for dynamic
type 'cause that's how all

544
00:29:31.896 --> 00:29:32.696 A:middle
of this was made.

545
00:29:33.246 --> 00:29:34.426 A:middle
This is really good way to go.

546
00:29:35.106 --> 00:29:37.496 A:middle
If you use this, you're
going to have great results.

547
00:29:37.826 --> 00:29:42.126 A:middle
Now, the other thing
is we have large blocks

548
00:29:42.126 --> 00:29:44.946 A:middle
of text they have mailed
from both the 6 and 7 here.

549
00:29:45.626 --> 00:29:48.396 A:middle
And previously, we would
recommend as a baseline

550
00:29:48.706 --> 00:29:52.186 A:middle
that your fonts are 15 points or
higher if you have large blocks

551
00:29:52.186 --> 00:29:56.496 A:middle
of text that people are going
to need to read for a while.

552
00:29:56.696 --> 00:29:57.906 A:middle
Now, that's changed a bit.

553
00:29:59.256 --> 00:30:01.166 A:middle
We can't just say
make it 15 points.

554
00:30:01.166 --> 00:30:03.026 A:middle
Now, with dynamic type,
it's all scalable.

555
00:30:03.626 --> 00:30:06.306 A:middle
So these really mean,
what size of body text?

556
00:30:06.726 --> 00:30:09.106 A:middle
But this is the default
size which is large

557
00:30:09.376 --> 00:30:11.946 A:middle
and as you can see,
the font size is larger

558
00:30:11.946 --> 00:30:14.806 A:middle
than what we have before,
and that's something

559
00:30:14.946 --> 00:30:16.486 A:middle
that we talked a lot
about on Wednesday

560
00:30:16.586 --> 00:30:18.626 A:middle
which is the importance
of legibility

561
00:30:18.626 --> 00:30:21.926 A:middle
and I think even what we were
doing before, our minimum size

562
00:30:21.986 --> 00:30:24.026 A:middle
for fonts, for body
fonts, was too small

563
00:30:24.546 --> 00:30:27.256 A:middle
and the decision was made
to up it just because it's

564
00:30:27.256 --> 00:30:28.866 A:middle
so much easier to read.

565
00:30:29.626 --> 00:30:32.156 A:middle
Now, another important
thing about text is

566
00:30:32.156 --> 00:30:33.976 A:middle
that you want to have alignment.

567
00:30:34.646 --> 00:30:36.256 A:middle
Alignment provides structure.

568
00:30:37.076 --> 00:30:41.926 A:middle
It's the key to making an app
UI feel aesthetically balanced

569
00:30:41.926 --> 00:30:44.426 A:middle
and organized, easy to look at.

570
00:30:45.566 --> 00:30:48.156 A:middle
But beyond that, it makes
it easy to scan text

571
00:30:48.156 --> 00:30:49.506 A:middle
and find what you're
looking for.

572
00:30:50.056 --> 00:30:54.066 A:middle
This UI is static now but a lot
of times, when you're looking

573
00:30:54.066 --> 00:30:56.676 A:middle
at this, you're swiping it
quickly and you're scanning

574
00:30:56.676 --> 00:30:58.746 A:middle
for text, you're trying
to make out, you know,

575
00:30:58.746 --> 00:31:04.266 A:middle
I'm looking for text from Paul
Brennen or Michelle Humphrey

576
00:31:04.386 --> 00:31:07.156 A:middle
and you have to be able to
see that even as it's moving.

577
00:31:07.426 --> 00:31:08.686 A:middle
Alignment is the key to that.

578
00:31:10.116 --> 00:31:12.416 A:middle
And another important
about text, again,

579
00:31:12.416 --> 00:31:14.486 A:middle
you'll see a left
alignment, it's very clear,

580
00:31:14.486 --> 00:31:19.516 A:middle
just like before, is
breaking up your content.

581
00:31:20.436 --> 00:31:22.636 A:middle
Don't just slam stuff
together because you want

582
00:31:22.636 --> 00:31:25.276 A:middle
to cram more stuff on the
screen, onto the screen.

583
00:31:25.556 --> 00:31:27.856 A:middle
You need to break up the
text the people are seeing.

584
00:31:29.186 --> 00:31:33.546 A:middle
It helps you to see connections
between disparate lines of text.

585
00:31:33.896 --> 00:31:35.836 A:middle
So these phone numbers
are grouped together,

586
00:31:35.836 --> 00:31:38.456 A:middle
so I understand that whole
areas about phone numbers

587
00:31:38.776 --> 00:31:42.006 A:middle
which is separate from FaceTime,
separate from sending a message

588
00:31:42.006 --> 00:31:44.026 A:middle
or looking up someone's
address on the map.

589
00:31:44.636 --> 00:31:46.296 A:middle
Negative space is
the key to that.

590
00:31:47.706 --> 00:31:51.106 A:middle
Use it well, use it liberally
and if it's not enough,

591
00:31:51.106 --> 00:31:57.166 A:middle
use separator lines to even-to
draw even clearer separations

592
00:31:57.216 --> 00:32:00.286 A:middle
between different
lines of texts.

593
00:32:00.406 --> 00:32:04.166 A:middle
And again, test on a device.

594
00:32:04.816 --> 00:32:07.086 A:middle
The reason why I'm
bringing it up now is

595
00:32:07.086 --> 00:32:10.076 A:middle
because when I'm talking
about contrast, when you look

596
00:32:10.076 --> 00:32:12.766 A:middle
at something indoors, it's
really easy to see all

597
00:32:12.766 --> 00:32:14.706 A:middle
of the nuances of the
different shades of color.

598
00:32:15.176 --> 00:32:17.966 A:middle
When you walk outside,
things are very different,

599
00:32:18.856 --> 00:32:22.046 A:middle
colors just compress into each
other, becomes hard to tell

600
00:32:22.046 --> 00:32:22.866 A:middle
that there's differences.

601
00:32:22.866 --> 00:32:25.576 A:middle
So you really want to make
sure that you're evaluating

602
00:32:25.576 --> 00:32:28.666 A:middle
if you have sufficient contrast
by walking outside and not

603
00:32:28.666 --> 00:32:31.566 A:middle
at night but at 2:00
in the afternoon,

604
00:32:31.756 --> 00:32:34.266 A:middle
when it's really
bright and sunny.

605
00:32:34.436 --> 00:32:39.466 A:middle
And also, there's a lot of great
tools available for helping

606
00:32:39.516 --> 00:32:42.266 A:middle
to look at UI and
analyze things.

607
00:32:42.706 --> 00:32:45.326 A:middle
LiveView is one of the
oldest, it allows you

608
00:32:45.386 --> 00:32:48.666 A:middle
to just take a design
and send it to a device.

609
00:32:49.646 --> 00:32:51.196 A:middle
Skala View is a great tool.

610
00:32:51.316 --> 00:32:54.976 A:middle
xScope Mirror has a lot
of pixel levels instrument

611
00:32:54.976 --> 00:32:56.286 A:middle
measuring stuff.

612
00:32:57.306 --> 00:32:59.046 A:middle
Screenshots Journal
also awesome.

613
00:33:01.396 --> 00:33:03.916 A:middle
All right, next Ambiguous
Alerts.

614
00:33:06.596 --> 00:33:10.536 A:middle
So we've all seen things
like this, maybe we had it

615
00:33:10.536 --> 00:33:13.816 A:middle
in an earlier version of our
app just for kind of debugging

616
00:33:13.816 --> 00:33:16.206 A:middle
and testing and sometimes
this app makes it

617
00:33:16.206 --> 00:33:20.216 A:middle
through to the final app and
this isn't helpful at all.

618
00:33:20.296 --> 00:33:21.956 A:middle
You have no idea
what's going on.

619
00:33:22.866 --> 00:33:23.856 A:middle
This isn't a real one.

620
00:33:24.226 --> 00:33:29.526 A:middle
I've changed the names
to protect the innocent.

621
00:33:30.616 --> 00:33:33.056 A:middle
This is a classic, again,

622
00:33:33.736 --> 00:33:37.366 A:middle
this is real alert
that's-- has existed.

623
00:33:37.446 --> 00:33:39.386 A:middle
What are you suppose to do here?

624
00:33:41.796 --> 00:33:46.556 A:middle
[laughter] Catch-22.

625
00:33:47.186 --> 00:33:49.736 A:middle
So be conscious of that.

626
00:33:50.056 --> 00:33:53.616 A:middle
This also, obviously it's
funny because, you know, well,

627
00:33:53.616 --> 00:33:54.526 A:middle
you guys all got the joke,

628
00:33:55.026 --> 00:33:57.316 A:middle
but this also demonstrates
something really important

629
00:33:57.316 --> 00:33:59.246 A:middle
which is that OK,
it's on the left

630
00:33:59.396 --> 00:34:00.876 A:middle
and you never want to do that.

631
00:34:00.876 --> 00:34:02.106 A:middle
You always want the affirmative,

632
00:34:02.396 --> 00:34:05.066 A:middle
the forward moving
action to be on the right.

633
00:34:07.456 --> 00:34:10.666 A:middle
Now, the best alert is no alert.

634
00:34:11.735 --> 00:34:15.585 A:middle
Alerts are really meant to call
your attention to something,

635
00:34:15.735 --> 00:34:17.346 A:middle
you know, something that
needs your attention

636
00:34:17.346 --> 00:34:18.906 A:middle
and it makes you aware
of that by popping

637
00:34:18.906 --> 00:34:20.255 A:middle
up this whole thing
in front of you.

638
00:34:21.045 --> 00:34:22.556 A:middle
But oftentimes, that's
unnecessary.

639
00:34:22.596 --> 00:34:26.545 A:middle
So if we showed an alert
every time mail was able

640
00:34:26.545 --> 00:34:28.476 A:middle
to successfully update
its contents,

641
00:34:28.476 --> 00:34:31.045 A:middle
that will get pretty
annoying pretty quick.

642
00:34:31.976 --> 00:34:34.056 A:middle
So we just have some
status text that tells you

643
00:34:34.056 --> 00:34:35.226 A:middle
when it was last updated.

644
00:34:35.795 --> 00:34:37.846 A:middle
Try to do that.

645
00:34:37.846 --> 00:34:42.286 A:middle
Try to integrate information
that's updating and changing

646
00:34:42.286 --> 00:34:46.686 A:middle
into your app UI if you can.

647
00:34:46.906 --> 00:34:48.295 A:middle
This is from iOS 6.

648
00:34:48.985 --> 00:34:50.146 A:middle
This is a really valid point.

649
00:34:50.576 --> 00:34:54.146 A:middle
When you bring up an
alert, label your buttons

650
00:34:54.146 --> 00:34:58.016 A:middle
with the action that
they're going to perform.

651
00:34:58.116 --> 00:35:00.706 A:middle
People are using your
device-- people are--

652
00:35:00.916 --> 00:35:04.236 A:middle
we're all using these
devices and we're distracted

653
00:35:04.236 --> 00:35:06.376 A:middle
and we get a phone call, we
might not be paying a whole lot

654
00:35:06.376 --> 00:35:08.216 A:middle
of attention, we might
of skim the question

655
00:35:08.216 --> 00:35:10.646 A:middle
or the message that's
in the alert but we have

656
00:35:10.676 --> 00:35:13.276 A:middle
to press the button and that
usually focuses our attention a

657
00:35:13.276 --> 00:35:14.016 A:middle
little bit more.

658
00:35:14.316 --> 00:35:17.326 A:middle
So if we read some text
about the resulting actions,

659
00:35:17.886 --> 00:35:19.626 A:middle
then it's going to be
a little bit safer,

660
00:35:20.006 --> 00:35:21.616 A:middle
it's more of a guarantee
that people are going

661
00:35:21.616 --> 00:35:22.746 A:middle
to make the right choice.

662
00:35:23.066 --> 00:35:26.876 A:middle
And while we're talking
about that, we should avoid

663
00:35:26.996 --> 00:35:30.296 A:middle
if at all possible, simple
button labels like Yes

664
00:35:30.296 --> 00:35:33.066 A:middle
and No or OK and Cancel.

665
00:35:33.066 --> 00:35:35.376 A:middle
If you can get more
specific, please do that.

666
00:35:35.596 --> 00:35:37.246 A:middle
It's really helpful
for your users.

667
00:35:37.646 --> 00:35:40.916 A:middle
Now, if you've been paying
really close attention on iOS 7,

668
00:35:40.916 --> 00:35:41.756 A:middle
you've actually noticed

669
00:35:41.756 --> 00:35:44.156 A:middle
that that this particular
alert has changed.

670
00:35:45.346 --> 00:35:47.856 A:middle
We added the option to
snooze when you get an alert.

671
00:35:48.786 --> 00:35:51.156 A:middle
And rather than cramming
too many choices,

672
00:35:51.866 --> 00:35:54.156 A:middle
rather than presenting the user

673
00:35:54.156 --> 00:35:55.946 A:middle
with too many choices
right off the bat,

674
00:35:56.836 --> 00:35:59.336 A:middle
you're given two many
options, just say OK,

675
00:35:59.696 --> 00:36:03.386 A:middle
or to look at what options
are available to you and then

676
00:36:03.386 --> 00:36:06.716 A:middle
and only then do we show
Snooze and to View Event.

677
00:36:06.716 --> 00:36:08.766 A:middle
But again, you can see these
labels are very specific

678
00:36:08.816 --> 00:36:10.706 A:middle
about what actions
they'll perform.

679
00:36:11.046 --> 00:36:17.716 A:middle
All right, and I already
talked this a little bit

680
00:36:17.936 --> 00:36:21.586 A:middle
but put the affirmative
action on the right.

681
00:36:22.336 --> 00:36:25.966 A:middle
Now, there's a bit of a
disagreement between Apple

682
00:36:25.966 --> 00:36:28.586 A:middle
and Microsoft about what the
right approach is to do here,

683
00:36:29.006 --> 00:36:33.036 A:middle
and in fact, sometimes I chuckle
when I go to an ATM or I look

684
00:36:33.036 --> 00:36:36.786 A:middle
at a website that has this
kind of buttons and I see OK is

685
00:36:36.786 --> 00:36:38.826 A:middle
on the left or Yes
is on the left.

686
00:36:39.076 --> 00:36:40.256 A:middle
I know that the designer

687
00:36:40.256 --> 00:36:43.306 A:middle
who made it is using
a Windows machine.

688
00:36:43.796 --> 00:36:44.726 A:middle
That's what they're used to.

689
00:36:45.616 --> 00:36:46.546 A:middle
Now you will too.

690
00:36:47.546 --> 00:36:52.106 A:middle
And I don't know if we're ever
going to see eye to eye on this.

691
00:36:52.106 --> 00:36:54.476 A:middle
I hope that Microsoft will
come around and see the error

692
00:36:54.476 --> 00:36:57.946 A:middle
of their ways but it's
been a couple of decades

693
00:36:57.946 --> 00:36:59.926 A:middle
so I'm not going
to hold my breath.

694
00:37:00.666 --> 00:37:02.836 A:middle
So in the meantime, just
recognize that the people

695
00:37:02.836 --> 00:37:06.896 A:middle
who are using your
apps on iOS are used

696
00:37:06.956 --> 00:37:08.376 A:middle
to a particular button order.

697
00:37:08.456 --> 00:37:11.046 A:middle
They're used to the affirmative
actions being on the right,

698
00:37:11.286 --> 00:37:13.296 A:middle
the forward moving
action being on the right.

699
00:37:13.826 --> 00:37:18.706 A:middle
And then finally, sometimes an
alert is not the right thing

700
00:37:18.706 --> 00:37:22.046 A:middle
if someone's about to perform
a potentially destructive

701
00:37:22.616 --> 00:37:23.846 A:middle
or harmful action.

702
00:37:24.556 --> 00:37:27.336 A:middle
If you delete this
photo, it's gone for good.

703
00:37:28.316 --> 00:37:31.256 A:middle
So it's really important
that users are aware

704
00:37:31.256 --> 00:37:32.746 A:middle
of the consequence
of their actions.

705
00:37:33.956 --> 00:37:38.456 A:middle
So use an action sheet
in cases like this.

706
00:37:38.686 --> 00:37:40.286 A:middle
And be sensitive to the order

707
00:37:40.286 --> 00:37:41.826 A:middle
that you're putting
these buttons in.

708
00:37:42.346 --> 00:37:45.406 A:middle
The most harmful, the riskiest
action should be at the top,

709
00:37:45.406 --> 00:37:48.476 A:middle
it should be the furthest away
from where your thumb is if it's

710
00:37:48.476 --> 00:37:51.856 A:middle
at the bottom of the device,
and it should also colored red

711
00:37:52.756 --> 00:37:54.696 A:middle
to give you that
reminder, that warning

712
00:37:54.836 --> 00:37:56.436 A:middle
that there might be
something harmful.

713
00:37:58.206 --> 00:38:01.726 A:middle
OK, next up, Out-Of-Place
terminology.

714
00:38:02.846 --> 00:38:05.826 A:middle
Now, a big part of making
apps, really easy to use,

715
00:38:05.826 --> 00:38:08.846 A:middle
really intuitive for a
broad range of users is

716
00:38:08.846 --> 00:38:11.946 A:middle
to not use jargon, not
use technical terms.

717
00:38:13.136 --> 00:38:14.686 A:middle
And it's hard for us to remember

718
00:38:14.686 --> 00:38:17.436 A:middle
that because we're still
comfortable with that language.

719
00:38:17.436 --> 00:38:19.476 A:middle
We use it all the time and
sometimes these terms are--

720
00:38:20.346 --> 00:38:21.916 A:middle
allow us to speak
with precision,

721
00:38:22.716 --> 00:38:25.026 A:middle
clarity amongst ourselves.

722
00:38:25.976 --> 00:38:28.836 A:middle
Not amongst the general
population.

723
00:38:29.486 --> 00:38:31.926 A:middle
So we could have called
Airplane Mode Cellular Baseband

724
00:38:32.426 --> 00:38:34.956 A:middle
but no one would
know what that meant.

725
00:38:35.146 --> 00:38:39.056 A:middle
Equally, we could have said
Add New GPS Indicator to Map,

726
00:38:39.796 --> 00:38:41.156 A:middle
but instead, we just
said Drop a Pin,

727
00:38:41.496 --> 00:38:43.686 A:middle
so much simpler, makes sense.

728
00:38:44.836 --> 00:38:45.406 A:middle
There we are.

729
00:38:46.016 --> 00:38:46.566 A:middle
Everyone wave.

730
00:38:47.086 --> 00:38:52.956 A:middle
And if at all possible,
avoid referring to the files.

731
00:38:54.006 --> 00:38:57.806 A:middle
iOS tries to obfuscate
the underlying file system

732
00:38:57.806 --> 00:38:58.766 A:middle
as much as possible.

733
00:38:59.206 --> 00:39:02.936 A:middle
So in Numbers, they don't
talk about untitled.numbers

734
00:39:02.936 --> 00:39:05.956 A:middle
or Create a New File, it's
Make a New Spreadsheet.

735
00:39:06.406 --> 00:39:11.456 A:middle
Next up, avoid Excessive
Branding.

736
00:39:12.416 --> 00:39:13.826 A:middle
I see this all the time.

737
00:39:14.916 --> 00:39:15.486 A:middle
I really do.

738
00:39:15.986 --> 00:39:18.966 A:middle
And if you show me your app
and it has a logo in it,

739
00:39:18.966 --> 00:39:21.786 A:middle
you're hear an earful about
why I think that's a bad I idea

740
00:39:22.086 --> 00:39:24.536 A:middle
because it's usually, the
logo is usually placed

741
00:39:24.536 --> 00:39:26.376 A:middle
in the nav bar, right
at the top,

742
00:39:26.376 --> 00:39:28.466 A:middle
right where the title should be.

743
00:39:29.076 --> 00:39:30.966 A:middle
So, again, WWDC app.

744
00:39:31.236 --> 00:39:32.826 A:middle
We could have put
the logo up there

745
00:39:33.386 --> 00:39:35.496 A:middle
but we don't want to do that.

746
00:39:35.496 --> 00:39:39.776 A:middle
It's a terrible idea
because that space is needed

747
00:39:39.846 --> 00:39:42.696 A:middle
for showing a title to tell
you what you're looking at,

748
00:39:42.816 --> 00:39:43.926 A:middle
tell you where you are.

749
00:39:44.546 --> 00:39:49.656 A:middle
My advice when people say, "Hey,

750
00:39:49.656 --> 00:39:51.146 A:middle
you know what we
put the logo there

751
00:39:51.146 --> 00:39:53.996 A:middle
because we think it's important
for building brand recognition."

752
00:39:54.686 --> 00:39:56.916 A:middle
I said, "That's the
wrong approach in iOS."

753
00:39:57.746 --> 00:40:00.166 A:middle
Sometimes you see a logo
showing up and you get the sense

754
00:40:00.166 --> 00:40:01.036 A:middle
that people are thinking

755
00:40:01.036 --> 00:40:03.086 A:middle
about their app is
though it was a website.

756
00:40:03.146 --> 00:40:06.126 A:middle
And with a website, showing
your logo actually serves a

757
00:40:06.126 --> 00:40:08.806 A:middle
functional purpose,
utilitarian purpose.

758
00:40:09.196 --> 00:40:11.346 A:middle
People can come to your
website from any other place,

759
00:40:11.426 --> 00:40:14.746 A:middle
though a link or wherever and it
helps them stay oriented to know

760
00:40:14.746 --> 00:40:17.676 A:middle
that they've gone from one place
to another, know where they are.

761
00:40:18.246 --> 00:40:21.176 A:middle
But that's not the case in iOS.

762
00:40:21.366 --> 00:40:24.176 A:middle
In iOS, someone presses your
app icon on the home screen,

763
00:40:24.376 --> 00:40:27.046 A:middle
they saw your logo
probably at that juncture

764
00:40:27.326 --> 00:40:29.396 A:middle
and the whole experiences
of your brand.

765
00:40:30.356 --> 00:40:32.956 A:middle
And if you're now showing
them a logo in place

766
00:40:32.956 --> 00:40:34.796 A:middle
of showing them some
information which is going to--

767
00:40:35.496 --> 00:40:37.466 A:middle
the title, which is going
to help them stay oriented

768
00:40:37.466 --> 00:40:38.546 A:middle
and know what they're
looking at,

769
00:40:38.876 --> 00:40:41.876 A:middle
then you're degrading their
user experience so they're going

770
00:40:41.876 --> 00:40:45.446 A:middle
to have a less positive
experience of your brand.

771
00:40:48.336 --> 00:40:51.046 A:middle
All right, enough about logos.

772
00:40:52.416 --> 00:40:53.916 A:middle
Uninformative back buttons.

773
00:40:54.826 --> 00:40:58.486 A:middle
If at all possible, please
label your back buttons

774
00:40:58.486 --> 00:40:59.526 A:middle
with something informative.

775
00:41:00.956 --> 00:41:02.066 A:middle
We don't do this.

776
00:41:02.856 --> 00:41:06.256 A:middle
We're in Settings and this
back button just says Back.

777
00:41:07.036 --> 00:41:08.836 A:middle
The error tells me
it's a back button.

778
00:41:09.166 --> 00:41:11.156 A:middle
I don't need text to tell
me I'm going to go back.

779
00:41:11.856 --> 00:41:13.746 A:middle
Now, I see a lot
of this and a lot

780
00:41:13.746 --> 00:41:15.146 A:middle
of times the explanation
is that, well,

781
00:41:15.146 --> 00:41:18.366 A:middle
we don't have enough
space to display the title

782
00:41:18.366 --> 00:41:22.886 A:middle
of the parent view, but
look at changing the title

783
00:41:22.886 --> 00:41:25.956 A:middle
of the parent view or the
child view to make that space

784
00:41:26.246 --> 00:41:28.646 A:middle
because it's a really
important way to allow people

785
00:41:28.896 --> 00:41:31.226 A:middle
to have context, to
know where they are.

786
00:41:31.226 --> 00:41:37.986 A:middle
All right, there's a connection
between the back button

787
00:41:38.286 --> 00:41:39.916 A:middle
and the title of
the previous view.

788
00:41:41.386 --> 00:41:46.176 A:middle
And what's more to iOS 7, we
have this really nifty animation

789
00:41:46.516 --> 00:41:48.456 A:middle
that makes that connection
very clear.

790
00:41:49.356 --> 00:41:50.606 A:middle
So if your back button
said Back,

791
00:41:51.696 --> 00:41:53.246 A:middle
this wouldn't work very well.

792
00:41:53.826 --> 00:41:58.896 A:middle
So, for example, if we just
said Back here, we wouldn't know

793
00:41:58.896 --> 00:41:59.906 A:middle
where we're going to back to.

794
00:42:00.686 --> 00:42:05.386 A:middle
We're looking at the info for an
event but where would I go back

795
00:42:05.496 --> 00:42:06.936 A:middle
to if I press that button?

796
00:42:07.896 --> 00:42:10.596 A:middle
Now, in actuality, what
we have is sets of events.

797
00:42:11.036 --> 00:42:13.286 A:middle
I'm just going to point
this out a little bit

798
00:42:13.286 --> 00:42:15.456 A:middle
because there's actually no
title in that parent view.

799
00:42:15.906 --> 00:42:18.766 A:middle
It's a segmented control
for filtering favorites

800
00:42:18.766 --> 00:42:21.646 A:middle
or just showing every event
for the schedule this week.

801
00:42:22.316 --> 00:42:26.036 A:middle
But it does connect to
the tab, the Events tab,

802
00:42:26.326 --> 00:42:27.466 A:middle
so it still makes sense.

803
00:42:27.466 --> 00:42:31.556 A:middle
All right, that was
the Back button.

804
00:42:31.916 --> 00:42:34.346 A:middle
Onto the second to
last common pitfall

805
00:42:34.866 --> 00:42:36.636 A:middle
which is Confusing Animations.

806
00:42:38.106 --> 00:42:39.486 A:middle
Now I see this all the time.

807
00:42:40.006 --> 00:42:44.656 A:middle
This is Stocks, and when you
bring up the settings UI,

808
00:42:45.726 --> 00:42:47.466 A:middle
it animates up, slides up.

809
00:42:48.306 --> 00:42:50.906 A:middle
And when you dismiss
it, slides down.

810
00:42:51.496 --> 00:42:55.136 A:middle
It's really basic,
really straightforward.

811
00:42:55.136 --> 00:42:55.886 A:middle
It's symmetrical.

812
00:42:55.936 --> 00:42:56.986 A:middle
It makes sense.

813
00:42:56.986 --> 00:43:00.286 A:middle
So now, when it comes again,
we're going to figure it's going

814
00:43:00.286 --> 00:43:01.696 A:middle
to come up from the
bottom because that

815
00:43:01.746 --> 00:43:03.636 A:middle
where it seems to have gone to.

816
00:43:04.236 --> 00:43:06.486 A:middle
It's persistence.

817
00:43:07.566 --> 00:43:10.046 A:middle
We imagine it'll still be
there down at the bottom.

818
00:43:11.416 --> 00:43:16.016 A:middle
Sometimes, things will slide
up and then they keep on going.

819
00:43:16.016 --> 00:43:19.326 A:middle
Where did they go?

820
00:43:20.466 --> 00:43:23.146 A:middle
Apparently, they're going to
fly all the way around the world

821
00:43:23.296 --> 00:43:24.836 A:middle
and come back to the bottom

822
00:43:24.836 --> 00:43:27.926 A:middle
so that they're there
the next time.

823
00:43:28.136 --> 00:43:32.526 A:middle
Sometimes, you slide up the
Settings and you dismiss it

824
00:43:32.706 --> 00:43:33.686 A:middle
and it just disappears.

825
00:43:34.796 --> 00:43:35.746 A:middle
That doesn't feel right.

826
00:43:35.746 --> 00:43:39.816 A:middle
It feels like they just forgot
to do the animation to go away.

827
00:43:41.656 --> 00:43:45.926 A:middle
Sometimes, bring up Settings

828
00:43:46.036 --> 00:43:48.666 A:middle
and you get something
totally different.

829
00:43:49.496 --> 00:43:53.646 A:middle
This is-- I picked this one
because Keynote let me do it.

830
00:43:55.226 --> 00:43:58.056 A:middle
And an iris wipe, that
might have made sense

831
00:43:58.126 --> 00:44:00.946 A:middle
but it should have come
on in the same way.

832
00:44:01.496 --> 00:44:03.336 A:middle
OK, it would have been a
really bad idea no matter

833
00:44:03.606 --> 00:44:05.096 A:middle
but you guys get point.

834
00:44:06.036 --> 00:44:11.336 A:middle
And then sometimes, you just
get gratuitous animation.

835
00:44:12.256 --> 00:44:16.146 A:middle
It's distracting.

836
00:44:16.596 --> 00:44:17.486 A:middle
It's unnecessary.

837
00:44:18.816 --> 00:44:20.176 A:middle
All right, enough
about animation.

838
00:44:21.376 --> 00:44:24.096 A:middle
So I'm going to end on
Inappropriate Styling.

839
00:44:24.686 --> 00:44:27.576 A:middle
Now, there's a lot of apps

840
00:44:27.576 --> 00:44:30.326 A:middle
that have a very distinct
visual style for them.

841
00:44:30.856 --> 00:44:35.216 A:middle
They might have some real world
materials like wood or fabric

842
00:44:35.776 --> 00:44:41.696 A:middle
and maybe you're making an app
that's for high school students

843
00:44:41.696 --> 00:44:43.426 A:middle
who are learning
about woodworking,

844
00:44:43.546 --> 00:44:44.586 A:middle
learning about carpentry.

845
00:44:45.856 --> 00:44:50.566 A:middle
So maybe the appropriate
background is a wood,

846
00:44:50.566 --> 00:44:54.866 A:middle
kind of cartoonish texture,
it makes total sense.

847
00:44:55.726 --> 00:44:56.506 A:middle
It'd be appropriate.

848
00:44:57.396 --> 00:44:59.666 A:middle
But the key to understanding how

849
00:44:59.666 --> 00:45:02.296 A:middle
to stylize your app
appropriately starts

850
00:45:02.296 --> 00:45:04.496 A:middle
with understanding
your intention.

851
00:45:05.416 --> 00:45:08.136 A:middle
So in everything I just said
right now, I had a picture

852
00:45:08.136 --> 00:45:09.576 A:middle
of who the app was for.

853
00:45:10.486 --> 00:45:13.096 A:middle
I limited it down to
particular age group

854
00:45:13.296 --> 00:45:17.646 A:middle
who had a particular set of
interests, and I picked a style

855
00:45:17.716 --> 00:45:19.246 A:middle
that was relevant to them.

856
00:45:19.416 --> 00:45:20.256 A:middle
That made sense.

857
00:45:20.256 --> 00:45:21.346 A:middle
It was a logical fit.

858
00:45:22.576 --> 00:45:25.796 A:middle
So let's look at some examples,
I think, of appropriate styling.

859
00:45:26.296 --> 00:45:31.896 A:middle
This is the UI for ProCreate,
one of the ADA winners.

860
00:45:32.466 --> 00:45:34.496 A:middle
I feel like I'm shilling
for ADA winners.

861
00:45:35.286 --> 00:45:37.086 A:middle
This is an appropriately
styled app.

862
00:45:38.026 --> 00:45:39.006 A:middle
It's a wonderful app.

863
00:45:39.846 --> 00:45:44.226 A:middle
Now every aspect, every decision
that they made around the design

864
00:45:44.226 --> 00:45:48.136 A:middle
of their UI was done so for
a very specific purpose.

865
00:45:48.636 --> 00:45:52.396 A:middle
This is a real tool
for real artists

866
00:45:52.606 --> 00:45:54.856 A:middle
and real illustrators
to do real work.

867
00:45:56.106 --> 00:45:59.436 A:middle
And that user base, they have
some very specific needs.

868
00:46:00.606 --> 00:46:03.706 A:middle
You want to make sure that
your UI doesn't distract

869
00:46:03.936 --> 00:46:07.716 A:middle
from your ability to see all of
the great details in the drawing

870
00:46:07.716 --> 00:46:11.446 A:middle
that you're making, so it's
dark, doesn't interfere

871
00:46:11.446 --> 00:46:13.576 A:middle
with that, doesn't jump
out in front of it.

872
00:46:14.176 --> 00:46:16.416 A:middle
And I talked about that
on Wednesday, deference.

873
00:46:17.166 --> 00:46:20.166 A:middle
This, I think, displays that
characteristic, it's deferential

874
00:46:20.256 --> 00:46:21.166 A:middle
to the user's content.

875
00:46:21.166 --> 00:46:25.516 A:middle
And it's got a texture to
it but the texture is matte.

876
00:46:26.536 --> 00:46:28.086 A:middle
If they went with
something glossy,

877
00:46:28.446 --> 00:46:31.476 A:middle
then they would have these
horizon lines in the reflections

878
00:46:31.476 --> 00:46:34.176 A:middle
and it would add to the
noisiness of the UI.

879
00:46:35.256 --> 00:46:36.716 A:middle
So it's appropriately styled.

880
00:46:36.716 --> 00:46:39.346 A:middle
Let's look at another example.

881
00:46:40.636 --> 00:46:41.916 A:middle
WWF Together.

882
00:46:42.886 --> 00:46:47.086 A:middle
Beautiful app and the theme of
the app is based on origami.

883
00:46:48.406 --> 00:46:51.666 A:middle
You'd make these origami animals
and then you can share those

884
00:46:51.906 --> 00:46:54.516 A:middle
with your friends on
Facebook or email or Twitter.

885
00:46:55.316 --> 00:46:58.446 A:middle
And they took that feature,
they took that concept

886
00:46:58.846 --> 00:47:01.526 A:middle
and they applied it and
used it as the style

887
00:47:01.526 --> 00:47:02.636 A:middle
of everything in the UI.

888
00:47:02.636 --> 00:47:07.576 A:middle
So this menu system, it
unfolds like pieces of paper,

889
00:47:08.336 --> 00:47:11.356 A:middle
and the background, it's a
little bit hard to see here

890
00:47:11.356 --> 00:47:13.656 A:middle
but it's got this
triangle shapes different--

891
00:47:13.856 --> 00:47:17.776 A:middle
subtly different variations of
light gray to really reinforce

892
00:47:17.776 --> 00:47:20.436 A:middle
that idea that this
is unfolded origami.

893
00:47:21.646 --> 00:47:22.836 A:middle
And it totally works.

894
00:47:23.046 --> 00:47:25.336 A:middle
This is an appropriate style
and it's totally unique.

895
00:47:25.596 --> 00:47:27.246 A:middle
It made sense, it's original.

896
00:47:28.316 --> 00:47:29.966 A:middle
Really original.

897
00:47:31.276 --> 00:47:36.216 A:middle
So imagine, if WWF Together
looked like ProCreate,

898
00:47:36.726 --> 00:47:39.866 A:middle
it was dark serious app.

899
00:47:40.466 --> 00:47:45.786 A:middle
Would that work for the purpose
of WWF Together or visa versa?

900
00:47:46.386 --> 00:47:49.656 A:middle
You would want ProCreate
to have this bright white

901
00:47:49.656 --> 00:47:51.406 A:middle
origami interface.

902
00:47:51.796 --> 00:47:53.096 A:middle
It'd be really distracting.

903
00:47:54.696 --> 00:47:58.006 A:middle
So let's look at a specific
example of something

904
00:47:58.006 --> 00:47:59.816 A:middle
which would be an
inappropriate style.

905
00:48:01.276 --> 00:48:03.686 A:middle
So this is photos from iOS 6.

906
00:48:04.236 --> 00:48:06.116 A:middle
If it had a wood background.

907
00:48:06.916 --> 00:48:10.236 A:middle
Now, at first blush, this
might look really pretty.

908
00:48:10.286 --> 00:48:12.036 A:middle
I think it's a nice texture,

909
00:48:12.036 --> 00:48:13.616 A:middle
I mean there's nothing
wrong with that texture.

910
00:48:13.946 --> 00:48:14.526 A:middle
It looks awesome.

911
00:48:15.936 --> 00:48:19.506 A:middle
But it competes with
the photos themselves.

912
00:48:19.816 --> 00:48:21.476 A:middle
It interferes with your ability

913
00:48:21.856 --> 00:48:25.826 A:middle
to see clearly the content
that you care about.

914
00:48:26.426 --> 00:48:28.046 A:middle
It's not deferential.

915
00:48:29.076 --> 00:48:34.496 A:middle
So the real UI for iPhoto on iOS
6 or for Photos on iOS 6, sorry,

916
00:48:35.186 --> 00:48:36.676 A:middle
just has a plain
black background.

917
00:48:38.066 --> 00:48:42.336 A:middle
That's not really a theme
per se but it makes it easy

918
00:48:42.336 --> 00:48:45.356 A:middle
to see the photos and that's
what's really important.

919
00:48:45.926 --> 00:48:50.426 A:middle
So, again, you have to
think about your intent.

920
00:48:51.376 --> 00:48:54.656 A:middle
Now, that's generally good
advice for anything you do

921
00:48:55.406 --> 00:48:57.586 A:middle
and especially with
design of your product,

922
00:48:58.826 --> 00:49:00.806 A:middle
but that's just the first step.

923
00:49:01.576 --> 00:49:06.466 A:middle
So, the designers of ProCreate,
they probably started saying,

924
00:49:06.866 --> 00:49:07.946 A:middle
"OK, who's our app for?"

925
00:49:08.356 --> 00:49:09.026 A:middle
It's for artists.

926
00:49:09.126 --> 00:49:10.536 A:middle
"But what do they need?"

927
00:49:10.756 --> 00:49:13.286 A:middle
They needed a UI which
is functional, efficient,

928
00:49:13.776 --> 00:49:16.236 A:middle
gives them quick access
to tools, doesn't distract

929
00:49:16.236 --> 00:49:17.726 A:middle
from the content that
they're creating.

930
00:49:18.266 --> 00:49:20.776 A:middle
Well, what works for that?

931
00:49:20.966 --> 00:49:21.726 A:middle
Dark palette.

932
00:49:22.326 --> 00:49:24.496 A:middle
Let's look at some similar
apps, what did they do?

933
00:49:24.496 --> 00:49:26.616 A:middle
What are the characteristics
of those apps?

934
00:49:27.376 --> 00:49:30.586 A:middle
So there's a progression of
considerations that you have

935
00:49:30.656 --> 00:49:37.036 A:middle
to go through but nowhere
in there is an allowance

936
00:49:37.336 --> 00:49:42.106 A:middle
for saying, "I just
like wood textures.

937
00:49:42.456 --> 00:49:43.406 A:middle
I think it looks pretty."

938
00:49:44.086 --> 00:49:47.766 A:middle
You have to avoid doing that
and think about something

939
00:49:47.766 --> 00:49:49.546 A:middle
which is appropriate
for your users.

940
00:49:50.566 --> 00:49:52.216 A:middle
It makes sense for
them and your product.

941
00:49:53.186 --> 00:49:56.256 A:middle
So those are the 10 common
pitfalls that I see all

942
00:49:56.256 --> 00:49:58.236 A:middle
of the time in iOS apps.

943
00:49:59.146 --> 00:50:00.786 A:middle
If you can avoid doing
these things, you're going

944
00:50:00.786 --> 00:50:01.826 A:middle
to be in really good shape.

945
00:50:01.916 --> 00:50:07.556 A:middle
So, I'm just going to
give a plug for the HIG.

946
00:50:08.146 --> 00:50:10.976 A:middle
I'm just really scratching the
surface with these 10 pitfalls.

947
00:50:11.616 --> 00:50:14.436 A:middle
There is wealth of
fantastic information here

948
00:50:15.026 --> 00:50:19.116 A:middle
which you can use to reference
and learn all about how

949
00:50:19.116 --> 00:50:22.976 A:middle
to use controls and what rules
to follow, what things to avoid.

950
00:50:23.036 --> 00:50:26.716 A:middle
I really urge you to read it, it
can be kind of dense at times.

951
00:50:27.766 --> 00:50:30.006 A:middle
I know it's not the most
approachable document

952
00:50:30.006 --> 00:50:33.796 A:middle
in the world and we're working
on that, but it's fantastic.

953
00:50:34.276 --> 00:50:35.796 A:middle
I've been designing
for many years.

954
00:50:36.006 --> 00:50:38.586 A:middle
I worked with people who
are equally experienced

955
00:50:38.816 --> 00:50:41.036 A:middle
and we're always
referencing this document,

956
00:50:41.366 --> 00:50:43.746 A:middle
we're always pointing each
other in the direction

957
00:50:43.746 --> 00:50:47.056 A:middle
of some particular passage which
gives us guidance about how

958
00:50:47.056 --> 00:50:48.896 A:middle
to do our job correctly.

959
00:50:49.476 --> 00:50:52.086 A:middle
I have some final thoughts.

960
00:50:53.336 --> 00:50:57.136 A:middle
Actually, I just have one
final thought, which is focus.

961
00:50:58.696 --> 00:51:04.146 A:middle
Now, when we were designing
the WWDC app, we could have put

962
00:51:04.146 --> 00:51:07.486 A:middle
in all sorts of great
features, or all sorts

963
00:51:07.486 --> 00:51:11.486 A:middle
of additional features like
the ability for you developers

964
00:51:11.486 --> 00:51:13.016 A:middle
to network with each other

965
00:51:13.356 --> 00:51:15.336 A:middle
or to check the current
weather conditions

966
00:51:15.646 --> 00:51:18.696 A:middle
or provide a guide for,
you know, restaurants,

967
00:51:18.696 --> 00:51:20.706 A:middle
clubs or whatever
in San Francisco,

968
00:51:20.846 --> 00:51:24.716 A:middle
but we didn't do those things
because it would've detracted

969
00:51:25.026 --> 00:51:28.146 A:middle
from our core focus
which was to add videos

970
00:51:28.936 --> 00:51:30.226 A:middle
and to integrate Passbook.

971
00:51:30.936 --> 00:51:34.856 A:middle
And we have a team of some
pretty capable engineers

972
00:51:34.856 --> 00:51:38.976 A:middle
and designers who
are working on this,

973
00:51:39.196 --> 00:51:42.226 A:middle
but despite that,
this is hard work.

974
00:51:42.226 --> 00:51:46.296 A:middle
And in order to make those
features really work great

975
00:51:46.296 --> 00:51:49.216 A:middle
on the app, we had
to concentrate on it

976
00:51:50.306 --> 00:51:52.256 A:middle
and not get distracted by
doing all these things.

977
00:51:53.376 --> 00:51:54.576 A:middle
And that's my advice to you.

978
00:51:55.306 --> 00:51:57.176 A:middle
It's to not bite off
more than you can chew.

979
00:51:57.996 --> 00:52:01.236 A:middle
Figure out what your app can be
really great at and it's going

980
00:52:01.236 --> 00:52:05.876 A:middle
to just be one thing or two
things, and then devote all

981
00:52:05.876 --> 00:52:09.196 A:middle
of your energy to making
sure that that's rock solid,

982
00:52:09.676 --> 00:52:10.866 A:middle
that that's a better feature

983
00:52:10.866 --> 00:52:12.706 A:middle
than anyone else
in your category.

984
00:52:13.976 --> 00:52:14.746 A:middle
It's hard work.

985
00:52:14.746 --> 00:52:18.006 A:middle
Some of the things
we looked at up here,

986
00:52:18.256 --> 00:52:19.566 A:middle
they're not easy to achieve.

987
00:52:20.516 --> 00:52:22.196 A:middle
In fact, a lot of
times, it's important

988
00:52:22.196 --> 00:52:24.476 A:middle
to recognize the limit
of your capabilities.

989
00:52:25.246 --> 00:52:27.776 A:middle
Hire a designer to
do your app icon.

990
00:52:28.776 --> 00:52:30.346 A:middle
Hire a designer to do
your app interface.

991
00:52:30.346 --> 00:52:34.756 A:middle
This is complex stuff to really
get right, but if you want

992
00:52:34.756 --> 00:52:36.936 A:middle
to stand out on App
Store, if you want your app

993
00:52:36.936 --> 00:52:41.116 A:middle
to be really successful,
that's what it takes.

994
00:52:41.276 --> 00:52:44.466 A:middle
So, again, focus on
what you can do well

995
00:52:44.526 --> 00:52:46.666 A:middle
and knock it out
of the ballpark.

996
00:52:48.166 --> 00:52:49.006 A:middle
That's all I've got.

997
00:52:49.396 --> 00:52:50.496 A:middle
Thank you very much.

998
00:52:50.996 --> 00:53:05.640 A:middle
